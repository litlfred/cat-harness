title: 'MOUNTED ROOT: harness tools run from a remote-mounted cat-harness take the MOUNT as their root, not the instance being worked on'

Measured 2026-10-09 working who-iris's beans from who-iris's OWN repository
(cat-harness, core, tools remote-mounted inside it per `index.lock.json`).
Every script below computes "this instance" as `import.meta.dir/..` (or
`instanceRootFor(import.meta.dir)`), which in a separated instance's checkout is
the MOUNT — somebody else's tree at a pin — not the instance being worked on.
The split plan's blocker 3 (≈204 such sites) names the cause for the tools/harness
split; this is the same cause seen from the other side, and it is live today.

| tool | what went wrong from who-iris's checkout | state |
|---|---|---|
| `ensure-landing-sticky` | wrote cards into gitignored mounts; never declared who-iris's folio | **fixed** (instance-dir argument; bean `1yd7`) |
| `ingest-document` | "this repository declares 3 libraries: library, ../folio-assistant-core/library, ../library" — who-iris's own library is `../library`, relative to the mount | worked around with `--library ../library` |
| `gen-library-jsonld` (run by `ingest --promote`) | `INSTANCE_ROOT = import.meta.dir/../..`; folio-assistant-core's contributions never register, so `typesForKind` drops every block's `@type` (`folio-assistant-core:Prose`, `doco:Section`) and the core namespace — **promoted output is a regression**, not committed | open |
| `skill-register` | reads `package.json` from the instance's PARENT and runs `bun run cat <step>` — neither exists in a separated repository (no `cat` runner anywhere; package scripts spell `cat-harness/scripts/...`) | open (70lx carries the package scripts) |
| `ingest-document` staging | writes `ingest-staging/` inside the mounted cat-harness | harmless, wrong place |

## Done when
- [ ] one resolver — the instance being worked on is the CHECKOUT's root
      instance (or an explicit argument), never the script's own location —
      used by every tool above; mounted layers are read as dependencies of it
- [ ] the closure's contributions (kinds, block types) are registered from the
      instance's `needs`, so `ingest --promote` from who-iris's repo writes the
      same JSON-LD as the aggregate checkout did (diff = 0 on the three entries)
- [ ] a test that runs each tool from a fixture checkout whose harness is a mount
