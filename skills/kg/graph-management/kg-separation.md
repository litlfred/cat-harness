  Separate a Knowledge Graph into its own repository — as a CONTENT repository
  (files to read, no code) and a TOOLS repository (the code that writes and
  checks it) — once it is too large, or its consumers or cadence differ. The
  end-to-end method: the signals that trigger it, the preconditions, eleven
  stages each with the command that gates it, the owner's decision points, how
  identifiers, QA and publication move, how the parent consumes the result,
  rollback, and the post-move sweep that a move between the pair owes before
  the parent re-pins. graph-detanglement owns stages 1–3; this skill owns the rest.
  Bootstrap + bootstrap-tools is the worked example; cat-harness +
  cat-harness-tools is next.

# Knowledge Graph separation — the method

> Skill id: `kg-separation` · Package: `graph-management`
> Process: [`kg-separation.bpmn`](../../../processes/kg/kg-separation.bpmn)

Owner, 2026-09-29: *"need replicable process for when KG gets too large to
handle and skills"*, and on cat-harness: *"follow same methodology/house
rules/process"*. This is that method. It was written down from what the
bootstrap separation actually did and what went wrong on the way (bean `r3gy`,
`xsqm`, and 94 separation beans surveyed), not from a plan.

[`graph-detanglement`](graph-detanglement.md) is the practice for **stages
1–3** (declare in place, detangle, isolate). Read it for those; this skill
points to it and does not restate it. Everything from "split the tools out" to
"the parent's copy is deleted" is here.

## When — the signals, and none of them alone

Separate when the graph is **too large to handle**, or when a **business
reason** separates it: *"split only where consumers or cadences differ"*. Size
is often not the reason — bootstrap is 33 files and left because its readers
and its release cadence differ from cat-harness's. Record the signals in the
bean before deciding:

| signal | how it is measured |
|---|---|
| files and bytes per instance | `git ls-files \| cut -d/ -f1 \| sort \| uniq -c` |
| clone cost | `bun run cat health` → `repository-size` |
| gate time a content change pays | `bun run cat gates` (the gate count and wall time) |
| merge contention | commits per day on `main`; PRs re-conflicted before merge |
| cohesion and cut of the candidate | `bun run cat kg:detangle` |
| wrong-direction edges **within one instance** — modules bucketed into the proposed repos by path rule | `check:partition` (its root is ONE instance; read the scope it prints) |
| wrong-direction edges **between instances** — checked against each one's declared `needs` | `bun run cat kg:detangle:direction`, blocking in CI (bean `p11x`) |
| wrong-direction **references** — the prose axis, not the import axis | `check:reference-direction` |
| what the tools would drag along | the import cone of the would-be tools package (`check:tools-closure` once it exists) |

## Preconditions — each was learned from a failure

1. **Names agree before the cut** — directory, declared `name`, package name.
   A rename after the cut is a cross-repository change.
2. **One directory per instance**, so extraction is one move, not a sift.
3. **Every gate that guards the boundary has been watched failing** — plant a
   violation, see it red, remove it. Four boundary gates in this repository
   passed while guarding nothing (`4j3h` could not fail, `q2wn` could not see
   side-effect imports, `p11x` could not see across instances, `ymsu` was
   repaired before it ran).
4. **The owner's decisions are recorded in the bean** (the table below).
5. **"Generated output is the contract" is written down** (`319n`): what
   crosses the boundary is the generated file, and any tool may produce it.

## The pair: a content repository and a tools repository

A separated Knowledge Graph is two repositories, not one.

| | content (`<name>`) | tools (`<name>-tools`) |
|---|---|---|
| holds | files to read — `.md`, `.json`, `.bpmn`, generated schemas, READMEs, diagrams | the code that writes and checks the content — Zod sources, generators, README/diagram writers, content checks |
| code | **none** (FR-7 — a reader needs nothing installed) | yes, with a declared, minimal dependency set |
| depends on | nothing | the content, and nothing above it — `check:tools-closure` |
| is used by | the parent harness, pinned | the content's own checks, and the parent (a package) |

Owner rulings that make the pattern (2026-09-29, bean `xsqm`):

- **The Zod source moves DOWN into the tools repository** — not up into the
  harness. Zod in the harness makes a content release wait on the harness,
  which itself needs the content: a cycle.
- **The tools repository owns the content checks AND the README and diagram
  writers** — one copy, which the parent harness also calls. It is **not** a
  second harness: a content Knowledge Graph declares no visualisers. It is one
  toolset over swappable content — *"someone wants a different visualizer they
  can use different toolset"*.
- **Every tool is a script an agent runs as the actor in a process step.**
  Agentic first. A GitHub Actions workflow may be **described, but ships
  disabled**, and nothing that costs money runs unless the owner asks.
- **Harness output ABOUT the content stays with the harness** (hosted): its
  QA verdicts (`kgQaHomeFor`), translation templates (`translationsHomeFor`),
  exported graph and glossary ledger. The content repository carries only
  what its own checks need.

### Staged content with no tools repository yet — the finding, not the silence

An instance can be planned as a content repository before its `-tools` pair
is authorised (who-iris, 2026-09-30). Declare it — `separation: "content"` in
`<name>.json`; the content half of an existing pair is read from the tools
instance's `supports` and needs nothing — and kg:audit's
`content-instance-holds-code` records a finding naming every code file still
inside it. It is a `minor` QA **warning**, not a failure, by owner ruling
(2026-10-01: *"QA warning. not failure.. ok b/c small # tools"*): the owner
tolerates the code *for now* (*"iris specific tools for now ok in who-iris/"*),
and the warrant is that the tolerated set is small. It was `major` until then,
on the argument that FR-7 has no legitimate exceptions. A warning still names
each file, so the violation is never silent. The remedy splits by what
the code is: **generic** code (it works for any instance of its kind — any
DSpace catalogue, any PDF) moves into the platform and takes the instance root
as an argument; **instance-specific** code waits for `<name>-tools`. Bean
`eayu`.

## The stages

Each stage names its lane (a role in `cat-harness/scenarios/roles.json`) and
the command that gates it. A stage is done when its gate is green, never when
the work looks finished.

| # | stage | lane | gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Brief, measure the signals, claim | `authoring-agent` | signals in the bean; `bun run cat beans:claim <id>` |
| 1–3 | Declare in place, detangle, isolate | `authoring-agent` | [`graph-detanglement`](graph-detanglement.md) — all its gates |
| 4 | **Identity**: `name`, `version`, `iriBase`, `needs`, `nodeSchemas` in the declaration; move the base once | `platform-authoring-agent` | `iri:sync -- --from <old base>` then `iri:sync:check`; `check:node-iris` |
| 5 | **Hosted outputs out** of the content | `platform-authoring-agent` | the content leak test's pending list is empty |
| 6 | **Split content from tools**: create `<name>-tools/` as a sibling, move the code, cut its import cone | `platform-authoring-agent` | FR-7 (content holds no code); `check:tools-closure`; generated files byte-identical before and after |
| 7 | **Publication plan**: every identifier the content mints is a file some step publishes, at `/<version>/` and `/v<major>/` | `publication-manager` | `check:node-iris`; the site layout in [`instance-publication`](../kg-core/instance-publication.md) §"The release site" |
| 8 | **Rehearse standalone**: copy content + tools alone into a temporary directory and run the tools' checks there | `build-pipeline` | green with nothing else on the path; an empty tree exits non-zero |
| 9 | **Authorise** — report what moves, sizes, what breaks, and wait | `administrator` | the owner's answer ([`deletion-requires-confirmation`](../../conduct/conduct-core/deletion-requires-confirmation.md)) |
| 10 | **Seed**: the owner creates the repositories; once the source has settled, seed `main`, then the content and tools as reviewed PRs, with history | `administrator`, then `authoring-agent` | `bun run cat seed:ready --layer <name> --rehearse` answers `settled` for each layer, at seed time; then the seeding PRs reviewed and green |
| 11 | **Parent consumes, additively**: pin (a SHA while staging, a version once released), repoint imports, keep the parent's copy. After any move of files between the pair, run the post-move sweep first ([below](#after-a-move-lands--the-post-move-sweep)) | `platform-authoring-agent` | the parent green with the dependency declared; `check:published-refs`; every gate in the sweep table |
| 12 | **First release**: tag, publish `/<version>/` and `/v<major>/` | `publication-manager` | `check:version-bump`; every identifier dereferences ([`publish-verification`](../../sdlc/sdlc-core/publish-verification.md)) |
| 13 | **Cutover**: the one commit retiring the parent's copy into [`fsh-guts`](../kg-core/fsh-guts.md) as a verified archive (the deposit `state:seed --cutover` makes: it must extract to the exact tree removed, with a provenance note), deposited into the PARENT's fsh-guts before the removal, frozen, never refreshed or rendered: a relocation, not a deletion (owner, 2026-10-06; [`sub-kg-lifecycle`](sub-kg-lifecycle.md) stage 13 has the steps) | `administrator` | only after 11 and 12 are green |
| 14 | **Independent refinement**: each new release adopted by the parent as a reviewed step | `authoring-agent` | [`upstream-version-adoption`](../../sdlc/sdlc-core/upstream-version-adoption.md) |

**Nothing is committed to the new repositories before stage 10**, and stage 10
starts only when the owner says so. Until then the pair is staged as sibling
directories in the parent (`bootstrap/`, `bootstrap-tools/`).

### Ready to seed? — asked at seed time, not at rehearsal

A seed is a snapshot: one commit that names the source sha, with no history
(bean `iai8`). **Every open PR whose diff touches the layer when the snapshot
is taken is orphaned into the monorepo**: after cutover its change is in
neither the seed nor anywhere that reads it. Stage 8 asked whether the layer
stands alone, but the tree has moved since. So `GW_SeedReady` sits between
creating the repositories and seeding them, and asks again:

```sh
bun run cat seed:ready --layer cat-harness --rehearse --text   # exit 0 settled, 1 not yet, 2 unknown
```

| criterion | `not yet` when |
|---|---|
| heavy movers | an open PR labelled `heavy-mover` touches the layer or the next one up |
| next layer | any open PR touches the next layer up, which imports this one |
| layer load | more than five open PRs touch the layer |
| moves | an open PR deletes a file in the layer, or renames one into or out of it. A generator's own names do not count: an `owned-tree` path in `merge-conflict-patterns.ts` (content-hashed payloads, rail data) is renamed by every regen, so moving one changes what no seeded path means (owner, 2026-10-06) |
| standalone | `bun test` is red with only the layer and what it `needs` beside it, as sibling directories |
| upward paths | a path DECLARED in the layer — a Tool module, a QA criterion source, a render target — resolves only in an instance above it, so it breaks the day the layer stands alone |

These were the steward's hand-applied criteria (2026-10-02), generalised per
layer.

**A test about the WHOLE CHECKOUT lives at the top (owner, 2026-10-06, "Top-level
instance"; bean `7zz1`).** A test that reads several sibling instances at
once, or the aggregate root itself (`.github/`, `.gitignore`, the root
declaration, `beans/`, `todos/`, `memory/`, `fsh-guts/`), is red in every layer
it is placed in, so it goes in the root instance's DECLARED test home —
`folio-assistant-tests` in `folio-assistant.json`, at `test/` — never in a layer
and never at a path a runner hardcodes. Whatever names every layer belongs at the
top, so each layer below stays standalone-green. Split a file when only some of
its tests read the checkout, keep the fixture tests with their layer, compose
the moved paths from `ORIGIN_DIR` (the directory the test was written in), and
move a corpus describe whole when it carries a vacuity guard: a sibling left
behind passes standalone over nothing.

**A test reading an UPPER layer's files moves to that layer (owner, 2026-10-06,
"tests that read cat-harness-tools files => move to cat-harness-tools").** It is
red standing alone for the same reason, one level down: the file it reads is
not in its layer's closure. It goes in the upper layer's DECLARED test home,
which may import the lower layer — never the reverse — and it is split, pointed
back to and composed from `ORIGIN_DIR` exactly as above. Check first that the
file it reads really IS the upper layer's: a path written from the checkout root
(`cat-harness/src/…` read relative to the working directory) is red standing
alone over a file the layer does hold, and the fix there is to resolve it from
the test file, not to move it.

**A test that reads the checkout's GIT asks which of two things it is (owner,
2026-10-06, "Throwaway repository, plus moving the real-repo checks").** A
standalone layer is a fresh clone with no `origin` and one commit, so a test
handed this checkout's remote, `HEAD` or `origin/main` fails there on a missing
input. A test of LOGIC that merely reads git — address derivation, an upload
URL's shape, a commit IRI, resolving a short sha — builds a throwaway repository
whose facts it sets (`gitFixtureRepo` in cat-harness's
`test/support/git-fixture.ts`) and passes that root, with every assertion
exactly as strict; a function that resolves its root internally gains an
optional root parameter defaulting to today's. A check that THIS repository is
configured right — its own Pages address, its committed pages' banners — keeps
its assertion verbatim and moves to the top-level test home above.

**`upward paths` replaced `sibling discovery` (owner, 2026-10-04).** The old
criterion counted dependents that discovery could not find in a workspace of
sibling clones. Discovery is checkout-local on purpose (`cmsl`), so that count
could never reach zero, and it counted *instances* where the risk is *paths*.
On cat-harness it read 3 while 0 of 134 declared paths resolved above the layer.
Count what breaks, not what is out of sight.

**A seeding pair is not upward (owner, 2026-10-04).** When the code moved to
the tools layer, the harness's Tool nodes kept their `src/tools/*` paths and
resolve into their implementer through `needs` ("Trap 1"), so the count read
23 for the harness. The two are seeded in the same step, so none of those can
break on seeding day. The HIGHER instance says so, `seedsWith: [<lower>]` in
its declaration, because a lower instance naming one above it is the wrong
direction. `seed:ready` states such paths in its note and does not count
them; a path into any other instance above still counts.

Four things to keep straight:

- **The layer map is read off the declarations**: `livesAt.path` is the
  directory, the longest `needs` chain is the depth, and the next layer is
  every instance one level up that needs this one. Nothing in the tool names
  a directory.
- **Every threshold is in the decision table**,
  `decisions/seed-readiness-gate.dmn`. The script works out each criterion's
  verdict by evaluating the table with the other facts at zero, so changing
  "five" is a one-line edit to the table.
- **`heavy-mover` is a label a person applies** (owner, 2026-10-02). With
  none on the layer, the criterion passes. If the label cannot be read, the
  answer is `could-not-determine`.
- **The rehearsal runs only on request.** Owner, 2026-10-02: *"Optional, run
  only on request with --rehearse."* It copies the layer and its `needs` into
  a scratch workspace (~150 MB and ~8,000 tests for cat-harness) and refuses
  to start with less than 3 GB free. Without `--rehearse`, the standalone
  criterion is `could-not-determine`, so **`seed:ready` cannot answer
  `settled` until a rehearsal has run.** That consequence is the one constant
  `SETTLED_REQUIRES_REHEARSAL`.

Could-not-determine is never clean. GitHub lists at most 3,000 files per PR,
so a criterion that the unseen files could change is undetermined, and the
gateway answers `unknown` and stops. An unknown only withholds `settled`, though.
It never hides a finding that is already certain, so the table tests the
`not yet` rows first. `not yet` goes to *Drain*: land, close or re-target the
PRs it named, then ask again. The tool only reports. It never seeds, labels
or comments.

## The owner's decisions

An agent asks these; it does not settle them.

1. Separate at all, and where the boundary is — after the signals are measured.
2. The address base for the extracted graph's identifiers: under the parent, or
   the new repository's own.
3. Where verdicts about it live: hosted in the harness, or in the content.
4. What the tools repository owns, and how its checks run (agent, package,
   described workflow).
5. Authorise the extraction (stage 9).
6. Whether the first release is a draft with a tag, or the first formal
   publication ([`instance-publication`](../kg-core/instance-publication.md)).
7. The cutover (stage 13).

## Identifiers and versions

One `iriBase` and one `version` in the declaration. Identifiers a program reads
are `<iriBase><version>/…`; pages a person reads are `<iriBase>v<major>/…`
(`bootstrap-tools/schemas/release-iri.ts`). A base move is
`bun run iri:sync -- --from <old base>`, once. A `$schema` tag carries its
schema's own semver. The exported graph's own `@id` moves only when the new
repository actually publishes (`40fl`). A published node's identifier must be
its file's path (`check:node-iris`).

## Versions of the pair — same scheme, same start, then independent

Owner, 2026-09-29: *"on creation of new repo/staging dir, they use the same
SEMVER for simplicity at time of split. then they are managed independently.
some tools may be able to manage several different versions / ranges of
versions of the content."*

- **At the split, both start at the content's current version** — bootstrap
  was `0.1.0`, so bootstrap-tools starts at `0.1.0`.
- **After that each is versioned on its own**, by the same rules: semver, the
  bump computed from the exported surface (`check:version-bump`).
- **Tags are plain `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>` in each new repository** (owner,
  2026-09-30): a standalone repository holds one instance, declared at its
  root, so the tag needs no name. `check:version-bump` reads the plain form
  only there; a repository of several instances — the parent while the pair
  is staged — keeps `<name>-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`, because a plain tag
  could not say which instance it released.
- **A tools release says which content versions it handles** as a list of
  supported MAJOR versions (`bootstrap: [0]`), never a range expression —
  `instance-versioning` rule 2 forbids range syntax, and within one major a
  newer minor or patch only adds (`tagCompatible`). A tool asked to work on a
  content major it does not list refuses rather than guesses.

## How the parent consumes the pair

The owner ruled on 2026-10-06 (bean `0mpw`, `remote-mount.md`): **no git submodules, ever**.

| mechanism | when | details |
|---|---|---|
| **Remote mount** (`remoteMounts`) | staging & development | A declared directory fetched at a pinned 40-character SHA with a committed lock (`folio-assistant.mount-lock.json`) and consent record. Downstream checkout `.gitignore` automatically ignores mounted directory trees. |
| **NPM KG retrieval** (`kg-retrieve-npm`) | packaged distribution | `package.json` declared in `<instance>.json` (`role: "package-manifest"`). Tarball packed via `pack-tarball` with a `folio-binary-release/v1` integrity record, downloadable via npm install or GitHub binary releases (unhydrated source vs hydrated store). |
| **Package import** | published tools | The parent imports the tools' Zod schemas and pipeline writers as an npm package dependency. |
| **Upstream pins** | maintenance | `upstream-pins.json`, maintained by `upstream-version-adoption.bpmn`. |

### Separation lessons learned (2026-10-08, extended 2026-10-09)

1. **Downstream Gitignore Contract**: When remote mounts populate an instance directory in the consumer repository, the consumer's `.gitignore` must ignore the mounted paths. Otherwise, git treats external files as uncommitted local files. `index.config.json` automatically includes all `remoteMounts` paths in the generated `.gitignore`.
2. **Folded Layer Aliases**: When an instance or subgraph is folded into another (e.g. `cat-openapi` folded into `cat-harness` as named subgraph `openapi`), existing external forks or historical dependencies may still carry `needs: ["cat-openapi"]`. `schemas/harness-config.ts` maintains `FOLDED_INSTANCE_ALIASES` to resolve these transparently without breaking dependency graphs.
3. **Asset Permission & License Validation**: Pre-separation audits must verify `library/withheld.json` and copyright gates. Materializing or mounting a separated catalogue without verified asset clearance causes 404s and broken links on published documentation.
4. **NPM Manifest in the KG**: `package.json` is an authored pre-packaging asset in the Knowledge Graph (`role: "package-manifest"`), and `.tgz` release tarballs are tracked as `folio-binary-release/v1` state documents with SHA-256 integrity digests.
5. **No Relative Directory Climbing Across Repositories**: In a monorepo, files routinely import siblings via `../../cat-harness/` or `../../bootstrap-tools/`. Once separated into standalone checkouts, climbing two or three levels (`../..` or `../../..`) escapes the repository boundary into `.claude/worktrees/` or the parent filesystem, immediately causing `Cannot find module` errors and test suite failures. All cross-repository imports MUST be authored as package imports (e.g. `@litlfred/cat-harness/...` or via package `exports`), or resolved through package specifiers / tsconfig paths, NEVER through escaping filesystem `../..` traversals.
6. **No Fixed-Depth Repository Root Assumptions (`REPO`)**: Scripts in separated repositories often inherit `const REPO = resolve(import.meta.dir, "..", "..")`. In the monorepo, `scripts/../..` was the checkout root; in standalone repositories, `scripts/..` is the root, so `scripts/../..` escapes into parent worktrees. This causes scripts to either fail to locate `<instance>.json` or inadvertently scan sibling worktrees. Repository root resolution must be dynamic—searching upward for `<instance>.json`, `index.config.json`, or `.git`—rather than assuming a hardcoded directory depth.
7. **Clean Standalone Manifest (`package.json`) and Tooling Scaffolding**: When extracting an instance to an upstream repository, `package.json` must be normalized:
   - Operational commands must live under `"scripts"`, not leftover monorepo `"checkoutScripts"`.
   - Script definitions must NOT hardcode monorepo subdirectory paths (e.g. `"bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/..."` -> `"bun run scripts/..."`).
   - A standalone `tsconfig.json` must be present to prevent `tsc` from walking up to the monorepo root.
   - Explicit `dependencies` and `devDependencies` must be declared.
8. **Fan-Out Recursion Guard in `declaringInstances`**: When a mounted dependency carries its own nested `remoteMounts`, consumer remote fan-out resolution must not recursively mount sub-instances into roots that are already locked mounts of the parent checkout. Without filtering (`!lockedMountPaths(checkout).has(rel)`), `remoteFanOut` re-mounts nested dependencies directly into the child checkout's directory, mutating its pristine checkout tree, inflating its file count, and causing `treeDigest` verification to fail.
9. **Relative Directory Symlink Handling in Staging & Tarball Scripts**: In repositories containing internal symlinked directory trees (such as FHIR Implementation Guides with test structure links), recursive directory copy utilities (like `cpSync(..., { recursive: true })`) can trigger infinite self-copy recursion loops. Staging, site compilation, and packaging scripts must copy symlinks with `{ dereference: false }` or use archive utilities (such as `tar` or `rsync -a`) that preserve symlink references rather than traversing into directory cycles.
10. **Purely Declarative Ontologies vs. Companion Toolsets (FR-7)**: Purely declarative base repositories (such as `litlfred/bootstrap`) must contain zero runtime execution code, zero test suites, and zero `package.json` manifests by architectural contract (FR-7). All graph compilation (JSON-LD export, BPMN diagram rendering, site staging, and schema validation) is executed by the companion tooling repository (`bootstrap-tools`). The declarative repository explicitly marks its render exemption (`renderExemption: true`) in its root manifest, and tooling scripts accept an explicit target repository argument (`--repo <dir>`) rather than expecting co-located execution.
11. **Toolchain Decentralization (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `bunfig.toml`)**: Tools and harness subgraphs must possess full standalone toolchain autonomy. `package.json` must be a standalone package manifest (e.g. `@litlfred/cat-harness-tools`), `bunfig.toml` defines test preloads per instance, and `tsconfig.json` must set `"noEmit": true` and omit `rootDir`/`outDir` to prevent `error TS6059: File is not under rootDir` when cross-subgraph schemas or utilities are imported. See [`bun-use`](../../sdlc/sdlc-core/bun-use.md).
12. **Monorepo Coordinator Demotion**: Once tools and code are extracted to their respective packages, the root `package.json` is demoted to a private coordinator (`"private": true`) with narrowed `tsconfig.json` (`test/**/*.ts`). The root platform coordinates development workspaces, mounts, and integration tests, but never directly exports or publishes tool implementations.
13. **Ephemeral File Purging and Root Hygiene**: Ephemeral generated directories (`_kg/`, `build/`, `test-results/`) must NEVER be committed to the root repository or left unignored. Build outputs belong to the tool that produces them.
14. **Instance Memory Preservation**: Root directories `beans/`, `todos/`, and `fsh-guts/` are the instance's own durable working memory (the agent's plan, the user's todo queue, and the archival store). They are never overlaid across instances, never extracted to downstream packages, and stay at root by design.
15. **A cutover is not done until the instance has re-pointed and can publish itself (who-iris, 2026-10-09)**: folio-assistant consumed `litlfred/who-iris` remotely while who-iris still declared `livesAt: { repository: "litlfred/folio-assistant", path: "who-iris" }`, had no `iriBase`, and had never had stage 7 or 12. `livesAt` is not a comment: `remote-mount.ts` takes `livesAt.path` as the mount path and `seed-ready` reads it as "still staged". And `/who-iris/` had only ever been a mount inside the parent's site build, so `litlfred.github.io/who-iris/` served nothing. The generated pages also kept absolute links to the parent's paths (`folio-assistant/.../who-iris-approval/uploads/...`), which 404 once the bytes moved. Before stage 13: `livesAt` is gone, `iriBase` is declared, and the instance's own site builds from its own repository. Building that site exposed the next gap, that a downstream cannot compose a site without the harness's entire `docs/` graph, which is [Semantic subgraphs](../../../docs/proposals/semantic-subgraphs-2026-10-09.md).

16. **The replayer must never live inside a layer it replays (cat-harness cutover, 2026-10-09)**: every workflow in folio-assistant — and, through the reusable `folio-staging.yml@main`, every downstream folio's staging build — bootstrapped with `bun "<platform>/cat-harness-tools/scripts/mount-from-lock.ts"`. The cutover removed `cat-harness/` from the parent's tree, so the first step of every job failed with `Module not found "folio-assistant/cat-harness-tools/scripts/mount-from-lock.ts"` before any of the job's own work ran (measured on `litlfred/smart-ra#32`'s staging; fixed by folio-assistant#2518's dependency-free `.github/mount-from-lock.sh`, which fetches the pinned replayer). `mount-from-lock.ts` was written to break exactly this loop for `bootstrap-tools` (its own docblock: "the tool that would fetch it cannot be loaded until it is there") and then moved into a layer that is itself mounted. **Before stage 13**, grep every workflow the parent ships for paths into the directory being retired, and give the parent a bootstrap entry point that lives in the parent and needs nothing mounted.
17. **A downstream's CI is part of "green" for a cutover**: a reusable workflow called `@main` (`uses: litlfred/folio-assistant/.github/workflows/folio-staging.yml@main`) runs the PARENT's current workflow in the DOWNSTREAM's repository. A cutover that is green in the parent can therefore be red in every folio at once, and the red lands on whatever pull request the folio author opens next — it reads as their failure. Stage 12's "green" includes one dispatched staging run of at least one downstream folio after the cutover commit.
18. **A separated checkout must run its own tests and type-check its own subgraphs (cat-harness, 2026-10-09)**: measured in a fresh standalone clone, `scripts/tests/skill-coverage.test.ts` and `tools.test.ts` still read `<checkout>/../package.json` (`harness-schema-export.ts`, via `repoRootFor`) and fail with `ENOENT` outside the composed tree — lesson 6 by another route; and `tsconfig.json`'s `include` names `scripts/`, `schemas/`, … but not the named subgraphs `openapi/` and `archimate/`, so `tsc` was green while never reading them (both added to `include` in cat-harness#55; they type-check clean). A test or type-check that silently depends on the composition, or silently skips part of the repository, is not evidence the separated repository works.

## After a move lands — the post-move sweep

Learned on cat-harness bean `70lx` stage 1a (cat-harness e29c6429, which moved
`scripts/`, `src/`, `content/pipeline/`, most of `test/` and the archimate and
openapi scripts into cat-harness-tools d8d42ab), and on the index re-pin that
had to follow it (folio-assistant #2524, superseded by #2529; bean
`folio-assistant-beaf`, 2026-10-10). The move itself was one reviewed commit
in each repository. **Making the repositories that consume the move work again
took about twenty more PRs across six repositories and a day.** Nearly all of
them were one of the classes below. Run the sweep after a move lands and
before the parent re-pins (stage 11), and do not call the move done until
every gate in this table is green in a composed checkout at the matched pins.

| what still named the old home | the gate that catches it | how it was fixed in 70lx |
|---|---|---|
| A Tool node's `invoke.shell` | `kg:audit` criterion `tool-invoke-path-resolves` (CRITICAL; 43 of them) | cat-harness #84: the 47 invokes in `tools/index.ts` |
| Prose and commands in skills, guides, READMEs, BPMN documentation, workflows | `check:command-paths` | cat-harness #99: 170 lines in 83 files |
| A script's own usage string | `check:usage-paths` | cat-harness-tools #41 |
| Printed and RUN commands: "Run: …" remedies, generated banners, shell hooks, an e2e global setup that ran an old path | `check:published-instance-exports`, `check:invocation-parity`, `security:gate` (all three matched old paths by text), and the unit tests | cat-harness-tools #39, #43 (429 strings in 183 files) |
| A wrapper generator's list of the scripts it wraps | `bat:sync` / `bat:sync:check` (the writer errored on the first missing file) | cat-harness-tools #53 |
| Partition rules naming moved files | `check:partition` ("exact rule(s) name a file that is not in …") | cat-harness-tools #55: 332 dead rules removed (owner: "2y") |
| A kind-validator node pointing at a moved module | `check:kind-validators:require-all` | open: how a node in one layer names a module in the other |
| A writer's claims in `qa-refresh`: sidecars that used to be committed files the writer *rewrites* became output it *writes* | `qa:refresh` ("N file(s) no declared writer claims") | cat-harness-tools #27 |
| A visualiser route a generator computed by hand (the glossary page moved under its declared route) | `uml:overview` inside `skill:register` ("no glossary page at …") | cat-harness-tools #27: `declaredRoute(<core>, "glossary-page")` |
| A browser bundle importing a node-only module through a package import | `navbar:assets` ("Browser polyfill for module node:url …") | cat-harness #98 + cat-harness-tools #49: the constant moved into a node-free module |
| A directory declared inside another declared directory in the receiving layer | `check:layout-norms` (it stopped `qa:refresh`) | cat-harness-tools #54: `health/` out of the declared `test/` (owner: option A) |
| A file left in BOTH layers (`schemas/adjudication.ts` and `schemas/materialization.ts` were in cat-harness and in folio-assistant-core) | `slice:sqlite` / `slice:sqlite:check` (the KG export mints the same IRI twice and the slice dies on a UNIQUE constraint); `node-kinds:check` and `kg:export` do not refuse a duplicate on their own | delete the copy the move should have removed, in the layer that no longer owns it (folio-assistant#2529's session) |
| Paired artefacts a move split across repositories (`review-comments`, `glossary-terms` to folio-assistant-core; the GRADE lists to smart-base) | `skills:docs` ("page(s) produced by NO source"), `check:declared-dirs` ("absent — declared and not on disk") | pin the receiving commits WITH the removing one (below) |

### The rewrite rule

Rewrite a path **only where the file exists in the destination and not in the
source**, and **never in a record**. The first half keeps a placeholder or a
typo from turning into a different wrong path; the second keeps a file that
moved and was later re-created from being redirected. Records say what was true
when they were written, so they stay as written: proposals, todos, agent
memory, beans, provenance (library figures, terminologies), upstream pins,
vocab mappings, QA results and test fixtures. Generated files are rewritten by
re-running their generators, never by hand.

The rule is a Tool: **`rewrite-moved-paths`**
(`bun run cat paths:rewrite-moved --from-name <old> --from-root <dir>
--to-name <new> --to-root <dir> --prefix <moved dir> … [--keep <glob>]`). It
reports with file and line by default, applies with `--write`, and with
`--check` is the gate for a sweep that should be finished. Its test proves it
never opens a proposal, a memory or a fixture.

### Pin the pair together, and record each consent first-hand

**A move that removes files from one repository must be pinned together with
the commit that adds them to the receiving one.** cat-harness #81/#82 moved
two skills down to folio-assistant-core and six code lists to smart-base; a
parent pinning the new cat-harness with the OLD core and smart-base had those
artefacts in neither repository, and the gates said so only indirectly. The
fix was to pin core #20 and smart-base #27 in the same re-pin. The general
form: before a re-pin, list what each new commit removes and confirm the
receiving repository's pin contains it.

**Every pin is a trust decision with its own consent** (rule H8,
`remote-mount`): `trust.consent` names who, when, the exact ref and the
evidence, and `mount:remote` refuses a ref nobody consented to. A consent
relayed by another agent is not the owner's consent, so it is not recorded
from the relay alone. In 70lx the session wrote no consent record until the
owner's answer to a question naming the exact SHAs was relayed verbatim with
its time. A standing consent ("pin any main commit of these repositories that
includes a fix merged in this session, listed in the PR") covers only the
repositories and the window it names, and each pin made under it is listed
where the owner will read it. When a consented ref turns out not to do (a
consented `main` with no declaration of the instance), do not substitute
another ref: keep the previous pin and report it.

### The order that worked, and the rules for several sessions at once

1. **Fix the tools** (the receiving layer): paths, the checks that matched
   paths by text, bundles, layout.
2. **Fix the content** (the source layer): prose, Tool invokes, declarations,
   partition rules.
3. **Regenerate the content at matched pins**, in a composed checkout laid
   down from the parent's lock, to a fixed point (`qa:refresh` COMPLETE, then
   `bun run cat regen`, then every `--check` green on a fresh lay-down).
4. **Re-pin the parent** to those commits.
5. **Run `bun run cat gates`** on a fresh lay-down of the parent.

When several sessions work on one separation at once:

- **Hold pushes on a branch another session is superseding**; hand over what
  is unpushed instead of racing it.
- **Announce which gates each session takes** before starting, and re-check
  the open PRs and recent merges of a repository before opening one there.
- **Verify on the lock of the PR that will land**, in a fresh scratch copy,
  never on another session's checkout.
- **A measurement-only workaround stays local** (for 70lx, a baseline entry
  for the layout-norms defect, needed to run `qa:refresh` while the owner
  decided), is never committed, and is deleted once the real fix lands.

## Rollback

Until the parent is green with the extraction declared, the extraction is
additive and the parent keeps its copy; the cutover commit is the one unit
worth reverting, and since the copy is ARCHIVED in the parent's fsh-guts
rather than deleted, the archive restores the exact tree that was removed. After a release, a tagged version is never reused: roll back
with a new patch release and move the parent's pin back.

## Worked examples

### 1. bootstrap + bootstrap-tools
- Stages 1–5: bean `r3gy` groups A–E (#1486, #1503) — wrong facts, folio-only
  names, root-relative paths, graph typologies and `$schema` tags and QA out, IRIs
  under `https://litlfred.github.io/bootstrap/` with semver.
- Stage 6: bean `xsqm` — `bootstrap-tools/` re-created as a sibling; the Zod
  source moved down; import cone from 19 files / 11,577 lines to 12 / 2,249,
  `zod` only; `check:tools-closure` and `check:node-iris` added, each watched
  failing on a planted violation.
- Next: the README and diagram writers join bootstrap-tools; the publication
  plan; the standalone rehearsal; then the owner's authorisation.

### 2. cat-harness + cat-harness-tools (completed 2026-10-08)
- `cat-harness` (`litlfred/cat-harness`): owns the knowledge graph, declarative schemas, content adapters, and BPMN/DMN processes.
- `cat-harness-tools` (`litlfred/cat-harness-tools`): owns the MCP server (`src/server.ts`), concrete tool implementations (`src/tools/`), ambient moddle type definitions (`types/`), standalone `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `bunfig.toml`.
- Decoupled from monorepo root via `index.config.json` remote mount and locked via `index.lock.json`.
- 70lx stage 1a (2026-10-09) then moved the harness's remaining code into cat-harness-tools; the sweep that followed is [After a move lands](#after-a-move-lands--the-post-move-sweep).
