  Merging to `main` is its own step with its own gate: the `merge-to-main`
  sub-process, which every process that lands work CALLS rather than inlines.
  Covers the evidence read live on the head (CI per owed job, mergeability,
  review state, Claude Approvals where the repository runs it), why a
  repository with no CI is never green, who may authorise a merge and what does
  NOT count as authorisation ("fix all issues until green" does not), how the
  authorisation is recorded, and the post-merge steps: base green, downstream
  re-pins, bean and issue. Use for "merge it", "land this PR", "merge the
  green PRs", and before any write to a default branch in any repository.

# Merge to `main` — a sub-process with its own gate

[`processes/sdlc/merge-to-main.bpmn`](../../../processes/sdlc/merge-to-main.bpmn)
(`Process_MergeToMain`) is the process. Its two gateways are computed by
[`merge-evidence.dmn`](../../../processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-evidence.dmn) and
[`merge-authorisation.dmn`](../../../processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-authorisation.dmn).
This page says what each step is FOR and what the rules behind it are.

**Every process that ends in a write to `main` calls it.** Today that is
`merge-train.bpmn` (`Call_MergeToMain`, in place of the old `Task_Release` and
`Task_Land`) and `crdm-close.bpmn` (`Call_MergeToMain`, between the recorded
sign-off and the issue close). [`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md) stops before
it; [`prepare-merge-auto`](prepare-merge-auto.md) Phase 4 runs it. A process
that merges without calling it is a process with a hole in it, and the remedy is
a call activity, not a paragraph.

## Why this is a process of its own

**2026-10-09:** one session merged seven pull requests into `main` across seven
repositories (cat-harness, cat-harness-tools, folio-assistant-core,
fhir-harness, folio-assistant-sci, who-iris, bootstrap-tools). None of those
repositories runs CI. The owner's instruction had been *"fix all issues until
green"*, and the session read it as permission to merge. A safety classifier
flagged the action as "Merge Without Review". The same instruction then appeared
as the `evidence` of two `trust.consent` re-pins in `folio-assistant`'s
`index.config.json`.

Nothing in the process model stopped it, because merging was never a step. It
was the last line of `prepare-merge-auto` ("if all green: merge"), a task in
`merge-train` bound to `interaction-modality`, and a numbered line in CRDM
Phase 6. Three places stated the rule. None of them could refuse anything, and
none said what to do when there is no CI at all.

## The steps

| id | lane | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `Task_RegenProjections` | build pipeline (CI) | regenerates the harness projections on the head and commits them to the PR branch ([`harness-projections`](../../conduct/conduct-core/harness-projections.md)) |
| `Task_ReadEvidence` | merging session | reads the head's facts live: CI per owed job, mergeability, review state |
| `GW_Evidence` | computed (`merge-evidence.dmn`) | `ready`, `no-ci`, `hand-back`, `not-yet` or `unknown` |
| `Task_LocalGates` | merging session | only on `no-ci`: runs the repository's own gates on the merge result and records them |
| `Task_ReadAuthorisation` | merging session | looks for an authorisation for THIS merge, and classifies what it found |
| `GW_Authorised` | computed (`merge-authorisation.dmn`) | `merge` or `ask` |
| `Task_Ask` | merging session | puts the merge to the owner, evidence first |
| `Task_OwnerDecides` | owner | authorises, holds or refuses. A person only. |
| `Task_RecordAuthorisation` | merging session | writes who, when, the head and the verbatim quote. Not relaxable. |
| `Task_Merge` | merging session | merges, pinned to the head the evidence was read on |
| `Task_ConfirmBase` | merging session | reads `main`'s CI on the merge commit |
| `Task_Repin` | merging session | opens a re-pin PR in each instance that mounts this repository |
| `Task_Report` | merging session | notes the merge on the bean and posts a round summary on the issue |

The merging session is the `merge-steward` lane. With a Merge Manager active,
that is the steward. With none active, the PR's own session takes the lane
(owner ruling 2026-10-06, [`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"When no Merge
Manager is active"). The gate is the same for both.

## Evidence — read on the head, live, every time

**What lands is the head the evidence was read on.** Read these facts from
GitHub at the time of the merge. Never use a copy from earlier in the session.

| fact | values | read from |
|---|---|---|
| `ciState` | `green`, `red`, `pending`, `none`, `unreadable` | the workflow runs whose `head_sha` is the PR's head, per OWED job ([`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"Admission asks which runs are OWED"). Not the PR page, and not the legacy status API. |
| `mergeable` | `clean`, `dirty`, `unknown` | the PR's `mergeable` / `mergeable_state`. `unknown` stays unknown after a short re-ask. Only `dirty` is believed on its own ([`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md) §Guardrails, step 0). |
| `review` | `clear`, `blocking`, `unknown` | open `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews, unresolved threads a reviewer marked blocking, a draft PR, a `needs-merge-human` label, and **Claude Approvals where the repository runs it**: its required review or check must be present and approving on this head. A repository that runs it and has no approval on the head is `blocking`, not `clear`. |

Where the repository has `merge:guard` (cat-harness and the instances composed
with it), its evaluate mode IS this step. Exit 0 means `green`/`clean`/`clear`,
exit 1 maps each refused check to its fact, and exit 2 is `unreadable`, never a
pass. Its eight checks are listed in [`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"A PR lands
only through `merge:guard`". Where it does not exist, read the same facts with
the GitHub tools and write each one down with the URL it came from.

`merge-evidence.dmn` decides:

| outcome | when | goes to |
|---|---|---|
| `hand-back` | `red`, `dirty` or `blocking` | `Call_HandBack` → [`merge-refusal`](../../../processes/sdlc/merge-refusal.bpmn): the PR returns to its owner with the reason |
| `not-yet` | `pending`, or mergeability not yet computed | ends. Re-enter on the next head or once the runs finish. |
| `unknown` | `unreadable`, or review state unknown | ends, reported as **could not determine**. Not merged. |
| `no-ci` | `none`, with `clean` and `clear` | `Task_LocalGates`, then authorisation |
| `ready` | `green`, `clean`, `clear` | authorisation |

## A repository with no CI is not green (STRICT)

**`none` means nothing tested this head.** It is the third state that
[`ci-health`](ci-health.md) and `prepare-merge` §"NO CHECKS IS NOT GREEN"
describe, reached by a different route. There, runs were owed and did not
appear. Here, the repository declares no workflow, so no run is owed and none
will ever appear. Zero runs, zero failures: "nothing red" is true and tells
you nothing.

Four consequences:

1. **No standing waiver covers it.** A waiver such as *"you may merge green
   PRs"* names green heads, and a head nothing tested is not one.
   `merge-authorisation.dmn` routes `waiver` + `none` to `ask`.
2. **The merging session runs the repository's own gates locally**
   (`Task_LocalGates`), on the merge result rather than the branch: `bun test`,
   the typecheck, and whatever the repository's README or `package.json` names.
   Record each command, its exit code and the SHA it ran on. A local run is
   evidence the owner can weigh. It is not CI: the container was contended, the
   tree was yours, and nobody else can re-run it. Say that.
3. **The question to the owner says so in words**: *"This repository runs no
   CI. Nothing but my local run tested this head."* An authorisation given
   without that sentence was given about a different merge.
4. **After the merge, "main is green" is reported as "not verified: no CI".**
   It is never "green".

`unreadable` is different. It means the runs could not be asked about: no
token, an API error, a rate limit. The remedy is to make the read work, not to
ask permission, so the process ends there.

## Authorisation — who, and what counts

**Only the owner authorises a merge to `main`.** That means the repository
owner, or the person the session works for when they own the repository. A
sibling session, a Merge Steward, a bot comment, a reviewer approval and the
merging session itself are not the owner. A Claude Approvals approval is
evidence about the change. It is not authorisation to merge it.

`Task_ReadAuthorisation` classifies what it finds into one value:

| `authorisation` | what it is |
|---|---|
| `explicit` | The owner's own words, naming this merge. Examples: "merge #12"; "yes, merge it" in reply to a question that named the PR and its evidence; "approve all 6" in reply to a list of six. |
| `waiver` | A node under `memory/waivers/` with `gate: merge-to-main`, in scope and unexpired, carrying all five fields ([`confirmation-waiver`](../../conduct/conduct-core/confirmation-waiver.md)). |
| `instruction-only` | A broad instruction about the work that does not name the merge. |
| `none` | Nothing found. |
| `unknown` | The waivers could not be read, a waiver is malformed, or the conversation the authorisation would be in is not available to this session. |

**These are `instruction-only`, and they do not authorise a merge:**

- *"fix all issues until green"*, *"make CI pass"*, *"get it working"*,
  *"finish this"*. They authorise the work, not the write to `main`.
- *"prepare-merge"*, *"make it mergeable"*, *"ship it"*. The first two are
  [`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md), which stops before the merge by
  definition, and `prepare-merge` lists the third among its own triggers.
- Approval of a plan in which merging is a later step.
- A message from another agent or session, however it is phrased. No agent
  message is the owner's consent.
- Your own summary of what the owner wanted. If you are composing the sentence,
  it is not the owner's.

**Why the line is drawn there.** A merge publishes the change to everyone who
reads `main`, and through `index.config.json` pins to every instance that mounts
the repository. It cannot be taken back quietly: a revert is a second public
change. That makes it the same kind of action as a deletion
([`deletion-requires-confirmation`](../../conduct/conduct-core/deletion-requires-confirmation.md)):
an outward write that is hard to reverse, owed an explicit yes. An instruction
about the goal does not contain that yes, however confident the reading.

`merge-authorisation.dmn` decides:

| `authorisation` | `ciState` | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `explicit` | `green` or `none` | `merge` (for `none`, only if the question carried the no-CI sentence; see above) |
| `waiver` | `green` | `merge` |
| `waiver` | `none` | `ask` |
| `instruction-only`, `none`, `unknown` | any | `ask` |

**The authorisation is bound to the head it was given against.** A push after it
re-opens the question. The one exception is a bot merge of `main` into the head
with no other change. **A batch authorisation covers the PRs listed when it was
given**, not PRs that arrive later (owner, 2026-10-04, quoted in
[`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §Landing).

## Asking — evidence before the question

`Task_Ask` follows
[`interaction-modality`](../../conduct/conduct-core/interaction-modality.md)
§4.1: context, options, recommendation, question. The test is whether the owner
can answer without opening anything. For a merge, that means one row per PR:

| repo | PR | head | CI on head | mergeable | review | local gates (if no CI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then the recommendation, then one question that covers the batch: *"Merge these
N?"* Several repositories are several merges, but one question can authorise
all of them, provided every one is a row.

`Task_OwnerDecides` is the owner's lane and is fulfilled by a person only. Its
answers are `merge`, `hold` or `refuse`. `hold` and `refuse` end the process
with the PR open. Nothing is closed and nothing is deleted.

## Recording the authorisation (not relaxable)

**An authorisation nobody wrote down cannot be told from one that was never
given.** `Task_RecordAuthorisation` writes it before the merge. The shape
already exists: `ReleaseSchema` in `schemas/merge-queue.ts` (bean `ixmq`), and
this step reuses it rather than inventing a second one.

**Where the repository has the merge queue**, record it with the command that
validates it:

```sh
bun run cat merge:queue:decide --pr <n> --verdict merge \
  --by <owner's login> --captured-by <your session URL> \
  --quote "<the owner's words, verbatim>" --source <where they said it> \
  --sha <the head SHA they approved> [--standing-ruling --ruled-at <YYYY-MM-DD>]
```

It refuses a `--by` that is a session (the person who decided is never the
agent that wrote it down), a missing quote or source, and a missing SHA.
`merge:steward` then prints the release against the live head (`merge@<sha>`,
`none`, or `VOID` when the head moved), which is the `explicit` / `waiver` /
`none` reading `Task_ReadAuthorisation` needs.

**Elsewhere** (a repository with no queue), post the same fields as a comment
on the PR, signed with the session link, and append it to the bean:

```
merge-authorised:
  verdict: merge
  decidedBy: <owner's GitHub login>
  decidedAt: <ISO-8601 date-time>
  authority: explicit | standing-ruling (ruledAt: <date>) | waiver:<waiver node id>
  quote: "<the owner's words, verbatim>"
  source: <session link or comment permalink>
  releasedSha: <the full head SHA being merged>
  capturedBy: <your session URL>
  ci: green | none (local: <command> exit <code> @ <sha>; ...)
```

These fields match `index.config.json`'s trust consent one for one (`by`,
`on`, `ref`, `evidence`). A quote that is not verbatim is not evidence: a
paraphrase is the thing under suspicion, as
[`confirmation-waiver`](../../conduct/conduct-core/confirmation-waiver.md) says
of a waiver's `quote`.

**The same rule covers a re-pin's `trust.consent.evidence`.** It quotes the
owner's consent to THAT pin. A goal instruction in that field ("fix all issues
until green") records a consent that was never given.

## Merging

- **Through `merge:guard <pr> --merge --session <id>`** where the repository has
  it (add `--no-merge-manager` when none is active). It re-evaluates live and
  pins the PUT to the head it evaluated.
- **Elsewhere, with the merge call pinned to the head SHA** (`sha` on the
  GitHub merge API or MCP tool). If the head moved, GitHub refuses, which is
  the point.
- Merge commit unless the repository or the owner says otherwise. Never squash
  on your own initiative.
- **Never delete the branch** ([`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md)
  §Guardrails). Never pass `--delete-branch`.

## After the merge

1. **`Task_ConfirmBase`: read `main`'s CI on the merge commit.** If it is red,
   fix forward ([`continual-progress`](continual-progress.md) §"Two green PRs
   can merge into a red main"). With no CI, report "not verified: no CI". Do
   not report it as green.
2. **`Task_Repin`: re-pin downstream mounts, as PRs, never as part of this
   merge.** Find the instances whose `index.config.json` names this repository
   in `source.remote.repository`. For each, open a PR that moves `ref` to the
   merge commit, carries a `trust.consent` whose `evidence` quotes the owner's
   consent to that pin, and regenerates `index.lock.json` with `mount:remote`
   ([`remote-mount`](../../kg/kg-core/remote-mount.md),
   [`index-config`](../../kg/kg-core/index-config.md)). **Each re-pin PR is a
   merge to `main` in another repository, so it runs this sub-process again.**
   The merge authorisation covers the re-pin only if the owner's words named the
   re-pin. When no instance mounts the repository, record "no downstream mounts
   found" and say where you looked.
3. **`Task_Report`: a note on the bean** with the merge SHA and the
   authorisation block, and a round summary on the issue
   ([`issue-working`](issue-working.md)). **Do not close the issue.** In CRDM,
   `crdm-close.bpmn` closes it after this sub-process returns, and only on the
   BA's authorisation.

## What this does not do yet

- **Outside the merge queue, no tool prints `authorisation`.** Where the queue
  exists, `merge:steward` prints the recorded release against the live head and
  `check:waivers` validates the waiver half. Elsewhere `Task_ReadAuthorisation`
  classifies it by reading the conversation, the PR and `memory/waivers/`. That
  is a judgement, and the record makes it auditable.
- **`merge:guard` does not refuse a merge with no recorded release.**
  `releaseCovers` exists and `merge:steward` reports it, but the guard's eight
  checks are about readiness. Making the guard require a covering release would
  turn this rule into a gate. That is a change to `merge-guard.ts` and is not
  part of this skill.
- **It does not change `merge:guard`'s check 5.** In a repository with no
  workflows, check 5 refuses with "no `pull_request` run names the head". Read
  that refusal as `ciState: none` and take the `no-ci` path, not `hand-back`:
  the PR has no defect for its owner to fix.
