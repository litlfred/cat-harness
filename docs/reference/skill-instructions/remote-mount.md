# Remote-mount a harness

The owner, 2026-10-06, ruled on how a downstream folio gets the layers it is
built on:

- **no git submodules, ever**;
- **no `.deps/`**, because a dot directory collides with GitHub's conventions
  and with this repository's own dot-prefix guard;
- a remote mount is a **declared directory with a remote source**, pinned to
  a full 40-character SHA;
- the **defaults live in the harness's own declaration**, so a downstream
  never restates the paths;
- a downstream **may override** them **by id**, never by path;
- mounts are resolved **transitively** across the dependency closure;
- code arrives through the mounted code directories.

| | where |
|---|---|
| the process | [`mount-dependency.bpmn`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/mount-dependency.html); the per-subgraph view is the `remote` and `npm` flows of [`mount-subgraph.bpmn`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/mount-subgraph.html) |
| the schema | `cat-harness/schemas/remote-mount.ts`, plus the `remote` and `npm` members of `SubgraphSource` (`schemas/subgraph-source.ts`) |
| the tool | `bun run cat mount:remote` (`--plan` to resolve without writing), and `bun run cat mount:remote:check` (offline) |
| the entry point | `bun run cat state:mount`, which the session-start hook already runs |

## Mount, subscribe or associate: choose first

| you want | relation | what arrives |
|---|---|---|
| to **build on** a harness: run its scripts, import its schemas, read its skills as your own | **remote mount** (`source.remote` in `index.config.json`) | the harness's declared directories and those of everything it needs, at one pin |
| to **read** another graph and hold chosen parts of it | **subscription** (`subscriptions`): the [`kg-subscription`](kg-subscription.md) skill | a snapshot of its declaration, then parts you materialise one at a time through the five gates |
| to **know of** a harness and link to it | **association** (`associatedHarnesses`): the [`associate-harness`](associate-harness.md) skill | nothing |
| to **retrieve or distribute as a package** | **npm distribution** (`kg-retrieve-npm`, `source.npm`): the [`npm-kg-distribution`](npm-kg-distribution.md) skill | an npm `.tgz` tarball (unhydrated source or hydrated view) |

The test is whether **your code imports theirs**. If it does, mount. If you
only read their content, subscribe: a subscription gates every part through
copyright and purpose, and a mount does not, because the code it brings is the
platform you are built on.

## The two halves of the declaration

**The harness side** goes in the harness's own `<name>.json` and is written
once by the harness's owner:

```json
"mountDefaults": { "path": "cat-harness", "directories": ["schemas", "scripts", "skills"] }
```

What arrives is what the declaration NAMES: the declaration itself, the
chosen directories, and the instance-scoped files in its `assets` (its
README and AGENTS.md). A file the declaration does not name, such as a
`platform.ts` beside it, never arrives. Code the mounted graphs import has to
sit in a declared directory (owner, 2026-10-07: "Forks declare it", bean
`hupw`).

Both fields are optional, and each absence has a meaning:

- `path` absent means the instance's **home path** (`livesAt.path`, else its
  directory in its own repository).
- `directories` absent means **every declared directory whose content is in the
  checkout**. A `branch`, `family` or `remote` source is somebody's state, not
  part of the harness.

**The downstream side** goes in the checkout's root `index.config.json`, as the
`source.remote` of the instance it brings in. Which instances a checkout
instantiates, where each comes from, and the fallback for a folio with no index
are [`index-config`](index-config.md)'s rule. This skill covers only what a
`remote` source means once it is declared:

```json
{ "name": "<harness>",
  "source": { "remote": {
    "repository": "<owner>/<repo>",
    "ref": "<40-character sha>",
    "overrides": { "cat-harness": { "directories": ["schemas", "skills"] }, "bootstrap": { "skip": true } } } } }
```

The fields are a `remoteMounts` entry without its `harness`, because the
instance's `name` is the harness (`RemoteSourceSchema` in
`schemas/index-config.ts`). A folio with no index still reads `remoteMounts` on
its declaration. **Declaring a mount in both places is an error**:
`readDeclaredMounts` throws and names both files. `bun run cat
index-config:migrate --write` moves the entries across.

**Every tool that writes mounts writes through `writeDeclaredMounts`**, into
`index.config.json`, and none writes `remoteMounts` any more.

`overrides` is keyed by instance name, then by directory id:

- `path` moves an instance.
- `directories` replaces its default list. An id the instance does not declare
  is refused, not dropped.
- `skip` leaves it unmounted, and the lock records it as an answer.

## Why the default path is the home path

At its home path, a mounted instance keeps its position relative to its
siblings. Two things then follow with no extra machinery:

- `instanceRootsIn` scans one level deep, so it finds every mounted sibling and
  `needs` resolves exactly as it does in the monorepo.
- A relative import such as `../../cat-harness/schemas/…` finds the file it
  names.

Moving an instance by override is allowed, and the overlay still finds it
through the lock (`mountedInstanceRoots`, `mountScopeFor`). The override is
then responsible for any import that climbs out of the moved instance.

## The closure

1. The harness's declaration is read **from the pinned tree**, not from this
   checkout.
2. Each `needs` name is looked for in the same tree.
3. If it is not there, the planner looks for a **gitlink** at that tree's root.
   A submodule entry is itself a pin, so a need on `bootstrap` resolves to
   `litlfred/bootstrap` at the gitlink's SHA. The downstream gets the bytes and
   never a submodule.
4. A need the downstream already holds as a local instance is `local`: it is
   supplied by the checkout and never mounted over.
5. A need found nowhere is `missing`. It is never dropped.

## The lock, and the three states

`index.lock.json` sits beside the downstream's `index.config.json` and is
**committed**. It is generated by `mount:remote` and never hand-edited, which
is why it is a separate file rather than part of the index. Until 2026-10-07 it
was `<name>.mount-lock.json`. Readers still accept that legacy name during the
transition, and both present is an error. It records:

- the pins it was written for;
- for each instance: the repository, the SHA, how the pin was found
  (`declared` / `same-tree` / `gitlink`), the declaration's digest, each
  directory's tree digest, and declared instance assets (such as `package.json`);
- what was **not** mounted, and why.

The mounted bytes are **not** committed. With an index, each mount path is
ignored by a **generated block in the root `.gitignore`**, written from the
index (`check:index-ignores` is the gate). A path that block does not cover is
reported as missing, never patched locally, because a local exclude is
invisible to every other clone. A folio with no index keeps the old behaviour:
a path its rules do not ignore goes into the worktree's `info/exclude`.

**Mount path and route collisions (bean folio-assistant-t4xb).** A mount with no `path`
override lands at `<name>/` in the downstream root, beside the downstream's own
directories, and its site routes sit beside the site-wide ones. To prevent collisions on disk
and in route space:

1. **Reserved names:** `RESERVED_ROOT_AND_ROUTE_NAMES` in `schemas/remote-mount.ts` declares
   the one authoritative list of reserved root directories and site route names:
   `["skills", "tools", "docs", "assets", "glossary", "api", "payload", "STAGING", "beans", "todos", "fsh-guts", "uploads", "test", "build", "_site", "_docs", "_kg"]`.
2. **Mount path check:** `checkMountPathCollisions` (run during planning in `mount:remote`
   and by `bun run cat check:mount-collisions`) rejects any remote mount whose effective path
   (`path` or `<name>/`) collides with:
   - a directory the downstream declares in its own configuration;
   - a reserved root or site route name;
   - another mount's path.
   When a collision occurs, the error clearly states how to fix it: "set `path`" (on the
   instance's `overrides.<name>.path` in `index.config.json` or `source.remote.overrides`).
3. **Route rules:**
   - **Canonical:** every visualiser is reachable at `<base>/<harness>/<visualizer>/`.
     Every generated link uses that form unless an alias is declared.
   - **Alias:** `<base>/<visualizer>/` exists only when a declaration opts in via `alias: true`
     or `alias: "<alias>"` in its `Visualisation` declaration (`coverage.visualiser`). The site build
     refuses an alias that collides with another alias, a harness route, or a reserved site route,
     and names both claimants.
   - The route rule itself is in [`schema-management`](schema-management.md)
     §"Where a viewer publishes".

Every instance ends in exactly one state:

| state | means | exit |
|---|---|---|
| mounted | on disk, hashing to the lock | 0 |
| unverified-approver | mounted, on consent no `mountApprovers` list checked | 0, reported apart |
| missing | not on disk, edited since mounting, not in the tree, refused, or the lock is for other pins | 1 |
| could-not-determine | the fetch failed, a declaration or lock is unreadable, or an instance is reached at two pins | 2 |

Could-not-determine outranks missing, and missing outranks mounted. **A fetch
that failed is never an empty layer.**

## A changed lock re-renders the agent surface

**A mount is not done when the bytes are on disk.** A newly pinned layer can
bring new skills, renamed skills and new agent-memory entries, but an agent
does not read the layer: it reads what is **generated** from it.

| surface | generated by | from |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/commands/<name>.md` | `skill:commands` | every `user_invocable` skill in the mounted `kg` graphs |
| `.claude/agent-memory/<agent>/MEMORY.md`, `.agents/skills/`, `.agents/rules/` | `agent-memory` | the `memory` directories the mounted instances declare |

So when a `mount:remote` run **changes the lock**, it runs both generators
from the checkout root before it exits, and a generator that fails fails the
run. A re-pin commit then carries the new layers *and* the surface rendered
from them. `--no-agent-surface` opts out; `--check`, `--plan` and `--staging`
never run it, since they change no lock a commit would carry.

The list lives in one place, `AGENT_SURFACE_GENERATORS` in
`cat-harness-tools/scripts/remote-mount.ts`. A new generator of something an
agent reads (a rule file, a settings hook) is added **there**, not to a
checklist: a step a person has to remember is the step that gets skipped.
That is what happened on folio-assistant#2526, whose re-pin shipped the new
layers with the old memory and went red on three agent-memory tests. Owner,
2026-10-10: *"that should be a part of process/skills/tools when a
new/updated subgraph is mounted... it may have new agentic skills to
re-render and add. same for memory."*

The process step is `Task_RenderAgentSurface` in
[`mount-dependency.bpmn`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/mount-dependency.html),
between writing the lock and checking against it.

## Trust: what lets a mount proceed (H8)

A real mount needs a person's consent for that pin (`trust.consent`); a
`--staging` mount needs none. `schemas/mount-trust.ts` has the rules. Four
things to know (roast `1ygp` L4.2):

- **The lock records the basis** for each instance: `staging`, or `consent`
  with who and when. `mount:remote:check` re-runs the trust check against the
  current declaration, so consent withdrawn later reads `refused`.
- **A gitlink needs consent of its own.** An instance reached through a
  gitlink is another repository at another commit. Give its consent on
  `overrides.<name>.trust`, for the gitlink's SHA.
- **Who may consent.** Declare `mountApprovers` and a `consent.by` not on the
  list is refused. Without the list, mounts report `unverified-approver`: exit
  0, but never shown as clean.
- **A refused mount is not current.** Its old bytes stay on disk (an agent
  does not delete them). The lock records them under `unmounted` as
  `leftOnDisk`, and the check reports them as not mounted.

## Publishing a remote-mounted downstream — provision `gh-pages` first

A mount brings layers into a checkout; it provisions **nothing** on the
downstream's remote. A downstream that publishes a site needs a `gh-pages`
branch before GitHub Pages can be switched on, exactly as a new repository
does. Owner, 2026-10-01: *"need to create gh-pages branch before can turn
on"*; repeated 2026-10-07: *"need to create gh-pages before can deploy"*
(issue #2417).

The step is `Task_ProvisionGhPages` ("Provision gh-pages") in the
getting-started process ([`getting-started`](getting-started.md)
§5), with the semantics of `A_Provision` in bootstrap-tools'
[`render-kg-to-github-pages.bpmn`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/render-kg-to-github-pages.html).
Run `bun run cat-harness-tools/scripts/pages-bootstrap.ts --provision` (idempotent,
never forced; without the flag it only reports `unprovisioned` and the exact
command), then set Pages to **"Deploy from a branch: gh-pages, / (root)"**.
The worked example is litlfred/test — an overlay with remote mounts, its
`gh-pages` provisioned as `860f9c2` in litlfred/test#5 — written up in
[`repo-conversion`](repo-conversion.md) §5.

## Never

- **Never add a submodule** to get a dependency, and never clone into `.deps/`.
- **Never pin a branch or an abbreviated SHA.** The schema refuses both.
- **Never edit a mounted directory and expect a re-mount to keep the edit, or
  to throw it away.** A re-mount leaves edited bytes untouched and reports them
  as missing. Move the edit upstream, or delete the directory and re-mount.
- **Never mount over tracked files**, or over a directory that no lock says
  this mount made. Both are refused.
- **Never read `missing` or `could-not-determine` as "that layer has nothing
  in it".** A layer that is not mounted is absent from every overlay.

## Not yet

These are tracked on bean `0mpw`:

- `init-folio --link remote`;
- pinning `skill_fetch`'s `REFERENCE_PACKAGES`;
- the pilot (smart-ra drops its submodule);
- the first real consumer, the cutover tracked by bean `g8jp`.
