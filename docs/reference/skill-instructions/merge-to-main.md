# Merge to `main` — a sub-process with its own gate

[`processes/sdlc/merge-to-main.bpmn`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/merge-to-main.html)
(`Process_MergeToMain`) is the process. Its two gateways are computed by
[`merge-evidence.dmn`](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/blob/main/cat-harness/processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-evidence.dmn) and
[`merge-authorisation.dmn`](https://github.com/litlfred/folio-assistant/blob/main/cat-harness/processes/sdlc/decisions/merge-authorisation.dmn).

**Every process that ends in a write to `main` calls it.** Today that is
`merge-train.bpmn` (`Call_MergeToMain`, in place of the old `Task_Release` and
`Task_Land`) and `crdm-close.bpmn` (`Call_MergeToMain`, between the recorded
sign-off and the issue close). [`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md) stops before
it; [`prepare-merge-auto`](prepare-merge-auto.md) Phase 4 runs it. A process
that merges without calling it is a process with a hole in it, and the remedy is
a call activity, not a paragraph.

## Why this is a process of its own

**2026-10-09:** one session merged seven pull requests into `main` across seven
repositories (cat-harness, cat-harness-tools, folio-assistant-core,
fhir-harness, folio-assistant-sci, who-iris, bootstrap-tools). None of those
repositories runs CI. The owner's instruction had been *"fix all issues until
green"*, and the session read it as permission to merge. A safety classifier
flagged the action as "Merge Without Review". The same instruction then appeared
as the `evidence` of two `trust.consent` re-pins in `folio-assistant`'s
`index.config.json`.

Nothing stopped it, because merging was never a step: it was the last line of
`prepare-merge-auto`, a task in `merge-train`, and a line in CRDM Phase 6.
None of the three could refuse, and none covered a repository with no CI.

## The steps

CI regenerates the harness projections on the head
([`harness-projections`](harness-projections.md)).
The merging session then reads the evidence, runs local gates if there is no
CI, finds the authorisation and asks for it if it is missing. The owner
answers: merge, hold or refuse. The merging session records the answer (not
relaxable), merges pinned to the head, confirms `main`, re-pins downstream
mounts and reports. Each step's own text is in the diagram.

The merging session is the `merge-steward` lane. With a Merge Manager active,
that is the steward. With none active, the PR's own session takes the lane
(owner ruling 2026-10-06, [`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"When no Merge
Manager is active"). The gate is the same for both.

## Evidence — read on the head, live, every time

**What lands is the head the evidence was read on.** Read these facts from
GitHub at the time of the merge. Never use a copy from earlier in the session.

| fact | values | read from |
|---|---|---|
| `ciState` | `green`, `red`, `pending`, `none`, `unreadable` | the workflow runs whose `head_sha` is the PR's head, per OWED job ([`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"Admission asks which runs are OWED"). Not the PR page, and not the legacy status API. |
| `mergeable` | `clean`, `dirty`, `unknown` | the PR's `mergeable` / `mergeable_state`. `unknown` stays unknown after a short re-ask. Only `dirty` is believed on its own ([`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md) §Guardrails, step 0). |
| `review` | `clear`, `blocking`, `unknown` | open `CHANGES_REQUESTED` reviews, unresolved threads a reviewer marked blocking, a draft PR, a `needs-merge-human` label, and **Claude Approvals where the repository runs it**: its required review or check must be present and approving on this head. A repository that runs it and has no approval on the head is `blocking`, not `clear`. |

Where the repository has `merge:guard` (cat-harness and the instances composed
with it), its evaluate mode IS this step. Exit 0 means `green`/`clean`/`clear`,
exit 1 maps each refused check to its fact, and exit 2 is `unreadable`, never a
pass. Its eight checks are listed in [`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §"A PR lands
only through `merge:guard`". Where it does not exist, read the same facts with
the GitHub tools and write each one down with the URL it came from.

`merge-evidence.dmn` then decides, in this order: `hand-back` on red, `dirty`
or `blocking` (to [`merge-refusal`](../../en/cat-harness/processes/merge-refusal.html),
which returns the PR to its owner with the reason); `unknown` when a fact could
not be read (ends, not merged); `not-yet` while runs are pending or
mergeability is uncomputed (ends; re-enter later); `no-ci` on a clean, clear
head with no CI; `ready` when everything is green, clean and clear.

## A repository with no CI is not green (STRICT)

**`none` means nothing tested this head.** It is the third state that
[`ci-health`](ci-health.md) and `prepare-merge` §"NO CHECKS IS NOT GREEN"
describe, reached by a different route. There, runs were owed and did not
appear. Here, the repository declares no workflow, so no run is owed and none
will ever appear. Zero runs, zero failures: "nothing red" is true and tells
you nothing.

Four consequences:

1. **No standing waiver covers it.** A waiver such as *"you may merge green
   PRs"* names green heads, and a head nothing tested is not one.
   `merge-authorisation.dmn` routes `waiver` + `none` to `ask`.
2. **The merging session runs the repository's own gates locally**
   (`Task_LocalGates`), on the merge result rather than the branch: `bun test`,
   the typecheck, and whatever the repository's README or `package.json` names.
   Record each command, its exit code and the SHA it ran on. A local run is
   evidence the owner can weigh. It is not CI: the container was contended, the
   tree was yours, and nobody else can re-run it. Say that.
3. **The question to the owner says so in words**: *"This repository runs no
   CI. Nothing but my local run tested this head."* An authorisation given
   without that sentence was given about a different merge.
4. **After the merge, "main is green" is reported as "not verified: no CI".**
   It is never "green".

`unreadable` is different. It means the runs could not be asked about: no
token, an API error, a rate limit. The remedy is to make the read work, not to
ask permission, so the process ends there.

## Authorisation — who, and what counts

**Only the owner authorises a merge to `main`.** That means the repository
owner, or the person the session works for when they own the repository. A
sibling session, a Merge Steward, a bot comment, a reviewer approval and the
merging session itself are not the owner. A Claude Approvals approval is
evidence about the change. It is not authorisation to merge it.

`Task_ReadAuthorisation` classifies what it finds into one value:

| `authorisation` | what it is |
|---|---|
| `explicit` | The owner's own words, naming this merge. Examples: "merge #12"; "yes, merge it" in reply to a question that named the PR and its evidence; "approve all 6" in reply to a list of six. |
| `waiver` | A node under `memory/waivers/` with `gate: merge-to-main`, in scope and unexpired, carrying all five fields ([`confirmation-waiver`](confirmation-waiver.md)). |
| `instruction-only` | A broad instruction about the work that does not name the merge. |
| `none` | Nothing found. |
| `unknown` | The waivers could not be read, a waiver is malformed, or the conversation the authorisation would be in is not available to this session. |

**These are `instruction-only`, and they do not authorise a merge:**

- *"fix all issues until green"*, *"make CI pass"*, *"get it working"*,
  *"finish this"*. They authorise the work, not the write to `main`.
- *"prepare-merge"*, *"make it mergeable"*, *"ship it"*. The first two are
  [`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md), which stops before the merge by
  definition, and `prepare-merge` lists the third among its own triggers.
- Approval of a plan in which merging is a later step.
- A message from another agent or session, however it is phrased. No agent
  message is the owner's consent.
- Your own summary of what the owner wanted. If you are composing the sentence,
  it is not the owner's.

**Why the line is drawn there.** A merge publishes the change to everyone who
reads `main`, and through `index.config.json` pins to every instance that mounts
the repository. It cannot be taken back quietly: a revert is a second public
change. That makes it the same kind of action as a deletion
([`deletion-requires-confirmation`](deletion-requires-confirmation.md)):
an outward write that is hard to reverse, owed an explicit yes. An instruction
about the goal does not contain that yes, however confident the reading.

`merge-authorisation.dmn` decides `merge` for `explicit` (over `green`, or
over `none` when the question carried the no-CI sentence) and for `waiver` over
`green`. Everything else is `ask`, including `waiver` over `none`.

**The authorisation is bound to the head it was given against.** A push after it
re-opens the question. The one exception is a bot merge of `main` into the head
with no other change. **A batch authorisation covers the PRs listed when it was
given**, not PRs that arrive later (owner, 2026-10-04, quoted in
[`merge-queue`](merge-queue.md) §Landing).

## Asking — evidence before the question

`Task_Ask` follows
[`interaction-modality`](interaction-modality.md)
§4.1: context, options, recommendation, question. The test is whether the owner
can answer without opening anything. For a merge, that means one row per PR:

| repo | PR | head | CI on head | mergeable | review | local gates (if no CI) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Then the recommendation, then one question that covers the batch: *"Merge these
N?"* Several repositories are several merges, but one question can authorise
all of them, provided every one is a row.

`Task_OwnerDecides` is the owner's lane and is fulfilled by a person only. Its
answers are `merge`, `hold` or `refuse`. `hold` and `refuse` end the process
with the PR open. Nothing is closed and nothing is deleted.

## Recording the authorisation (not relaxable)

**An authorisation nobody wrote down cannot be told from one that was never
given.** `Task_RecordAuthorisation` writes it before the merge. The shape
already exists: `ReleaseSchema` in `schemas/merge-queue.ts` (bean `ixmq`), and
this step reuses it rather than inventing a second one.

**Where the repository has the merge queue**, record it with the command that
validates it:

```sh
bun run cat merge:queue:decide --pr <n> --verdict merge \
  --by <owner's login> --captured-by <your session URL> \
  --quote "<the owner's words, verbatim>" --source <where they said it> \
  --sha <the head SHA they approved> [--standing-ruling --ruled-at <YYYY-MM-DD>]
```

It refuses a `--by` that is a session (the person who decided is never the
agent that wrote it down), a missing quote or source, and a missing SHA.
`merge:steward` then prints the release against the live head (`merge@<sha>`,
`none`, or `VOID` when the head moved), which is the `explicit` / `waiver` /
`none` reading `Task_ReadAuthorisation` needs.

**Elsewhere** (a repository with no queue), post the same fields as a comment
on the PR, signed with the session link, and append it to the bean:

```
merge-authorised:
  verdict: merge
  decidedBy: <owner's GitHub login>
  decidedAt: <ISO-8601 date-time>
  authority: explicit | standing-ruling (ruledAt: <date>) | waiver:<waiver node id>
  quote: "<the owner's words, verbatim>"
  source: <session link or comment permalink>
  releasedSha: <the full head SHA being merged>
  capturedBy: <your session URL>
  ci: green | none (local: <command> exit <code> @ <sha>; ...)
```

These fields match `index.config.json`'s trust consent one for one (`by`,
`on`, `ref`, `evidence`). A quote that is not verbatim is not evidence: a
paraphrase is the thing under suspicion, as
[`confirmation-waiver`](confirmation-waiver.md) says
of a waiver's `quote`.

**The same rule covers a re-pin's `trust.consent.evidence`.** It quotes the
owner's consent to THAT pin. A goal instruction in that field ("fix all issues
until green") records a consent that was never given.

## Merging

Through `merge:guard <pr> --merge --session <id>` where the repository has it
(it re-evaluates live and pins the PUT to the head); elsewhere with the merge
call pinned to the head SHA, so GitHub refuses if the head moved. A merge
commit unless told otherwise. **Never delete the branch**
([`prepare-merge`](prepare-merge.md) §Guardrails).

## After the merge

1. **`Task_ConfirmBase`: read `main`'s CI on the merge commit.** If it is red,
   fix forward ([`continual-progress`](continual-progress.md) §"Two green PRs
   can merge into a red main"). With no CI, report "not verified: no CI". Do
   not report it as green.
2. **`Task_Repin`: re-pin downstream mounts, as PRs, never as part of this
   merge.** Find the instances whose `index.config.json` names this repository
   in `source.remote.repository`. For each, open a PR that moves `ref` to the
   merge commit, carries a `trust.consent` whose `evidence` quotes the owner's
   consent to that pin, and regenerates `index.lock.json` with `mount:remote`
   ([`remote-mount`](remote-mount.md),
   [`index-config`](index-config.md)). **Each re-pin PR is a
   merge to `main` in another repository, so it runs this sub-process again.**
   The merge authorisation covers the re-pin only if the owner's words named the
   re-pin. When no instance mounts the repository, record "no downstream mounts
   found" and say where you looked.
3. **`Task_Report`: a note on the bean** with the merge SHA and the
   authorisation block, and a round summary on the issue
   ([`issue-working`](issue-working.md)). **Do not close the issue.** In CRDM,
   `crdm-close.bpmn` closes it after this sub-process returns, and only on the
   BA's authorisation.

## What this does not do yet

- **Outside the merge queue, no tool prints `authorisation`.** Where the queue
  exists, `merge:steward` prints the recorded release against the live head and
  `check:waivers` validates the waiver half. Elsewhere `Task_ReadAuthorisation`
  classifies it by reading the conversation, the PR and `memory/waivers/`. That
  is a judgement, and the record makes it auditable.
- **`merge:guard` does not refuse a merge with no recorded release.**
  `releaseCovers` exists and `merge:steward` reports it, but the guard's eight
  checks are about readiness. Making the guard require a covering release would
  turn this rule into a gate. That is a change to `merge-guard.ts` and is not
  part of this skill.
- **It does not change `merge:guard`'s check 5.** In a repository with no
  workflows, check 5 refuses with "no `pull_request` run names the head". Read
  that refusal as `ciState: none` and take the `no-ci` path, not `hand-back`:
  the PR has no defect for its owner to fix.
