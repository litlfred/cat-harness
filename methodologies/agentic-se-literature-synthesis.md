# Agentic Software Engineering Literature Synthesis — Cross-Paper Synthesis and Bidirectional Adversarial Analysis

**Ingested & Synthesized under Epic `folio-assistant-0ipy` (Leaf Bean `folio-assistant-9k2i`).**
This node synthesizes the empirical evidence, architectural patterns, and failure modes across five
landmark papers in agentic software engineering (SE), spanning multi-agent SDLC taxonomies, competitive
debate adjudication, cost-aware temporal routing, adaptive swarm selection with early termination, and
tool-integrated pre-merge code review.

It maintains a strict epistemological separation between **Measured** empirical findings, **Recommended**
operational heuristics, and **Claimed** unverified hypotheses, followed by a **bidirectional adversarial
pass** that attacks both the literature's foundational assumptions and this platform's own 69 BPMN/DMN
processes.

### Synthesis Across the Operational Lifecycle

1. **Task Ingestion & Routing (SWE-Router + TCAndon-Router)**:
   Tasks enter through an adaptive gate. Rather than deciding statically at prompt-time whether a task is
   "hard" or "easy" (which suffers from a high Bayes error floor), the system executes a bounded exploration
   phase ($K=3$ turns with a lightweight model, or single-agent extraction for $|A_q|=1$). If the partial
   trajectory reveals deep architectural fault propagation, execution cleanly escalates to frontier models
   or specialized expert swarms.
2. **Investigation & Localization (SWE-Debate + He et al.)**:
   When localized diagnosis reveals cross-module ambiguity, unconstrained conversational chat fails
   catastrophically. The system bounds graph traversal to depth $L \le 5$ and deploys competitive multi-agent
   debate across competing fault hypotheses, forcing agents to defend claims against adversarial cross-critique.
3. **Execution & Gating (CodeAgent + Folio-Assistant Core)**:
   Pre-merge code verification is partitioned strictly by epistemological authority. Deterministic tools
   (compilers, linters, formal proof verifiers) act as hard blocking gates; multi-agent review teams execute
   tool-integrated consistency and vulnerability checks, emitting structured advisories ("would have blocked")
   supervised by bounded QA-checker loops. If structural anomalies or missing prerequisites emerge at any turn,
   the Andon cord immediately halts execution.

## 2. Epistemic Partition: Measured vs. Recommended vs. Claimed

To prevent ungrounded academic claims from leaking into production engineering rules, all assertions across
the five papers are strictly segregated into three epistemic tiers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ • SWE-Router (2607.00053v1): Static prompt-only routing achieves only 32.1% accuracy in predicting     │
│   task resolution. Value head on partial trajectories (K=3) reduces overall cost by 40–50% while       │
│   capturing 85–95% of frontier performance (Theorem 4.1 empirical proof). High-economy threshold        │

## 3. Adversarial Pass Direction 1: Attacking the Papers' Claims

A critical analysis exposes significant methodological flaws, hidden costs, and uncalibrated assumptions
in the published literature:

                               - No uncalibrated blocking gates
                               - No unconstrained multi-round debates
                               - Clean-slate context restarts mandatory
                               - Dynamic ontology over static cards
```

### 1. CodeAgent (arXiv:2402.02172v5): The Circularity Trap & Alert Fatigue
- **The Circular Annotation Fallacy (§4.1)**:
  CodeAgent claims a 92.96% confirmation rate for its vulnerability detections. However, Section 4.1 admits
  that ground truth was established by running CodeAgent over 3,545 commits and having human authors inspect
  *only the commits CodeAgent flagged*. Unflagged commits were never audited. This circular methodology
  completely masks false negatives and inflates apparent precision.
- **The 48.58% False-Positive Disaster (Table 2)**:
  Standalone frontier models (GPT-4) exhibited a 48.58% false-positive rate. Deploying an uncalibrated LLM
  reviewer as a blocking CI gate will trigger severe alert fatigue, forcing developers to bypass or disable
  the review system.
- **The Format Analysis (FA) Anti-Pattern**:
  Employing multi-agent LLM dialogue to detect indentation errors, trailing spaces, and bracket formatting
  wastes hundreds of thousands of tokens on problems deterministic linters (Prettier, ESLint, `gofmt`)
  solve in under 50 milliseconds with mathematical certainty.
- **Runaway Latency and Cost (Table 12)**:
  At 5 minutes and $0.122 per review, running synchronous multi-agent review loops across concurrent PRs
  in a busy merge queue would completely throttle CI throughput.

### 2. SWE-Debate (arXiv:2507.23348v1): Token Explosion and Judge Vulnerabilities
- **Quadratic Token Explosion in Multi-Round Debates**:
  Multi-round debates with cross-agent critique require each participant to ingest the full debate history,
  code snippets, and rival arguments at every turn. Token consumption scales quadratically with debate rounds
  ($O(N^2 \cdot \text{turns})$), rendering unconstrained debate economically unviable for routine software maintenance.
- **Discriminator Bias and Hallucination Aggregation**:
  The Round 3 Discriminator (Prompt 8) is itself an LLM subject to well-documented cognitive biases: length
  bias (favoring longer, more verbose arguments), position bias (favoring the last argument presented), and
  prestige bias. If two debaters introduce subtly flawed reasoning, the discriminator frequently synthesizes
  a compromise that combines both errors rather than identifying the underlying defect.
- **The Horizon Noise Cliff ($L > 5$)**:
  The paper's own ablation study (Figure 3) demonstrates that expanding dependency graph traversal from $L=5$
  to $L=7$ causes localization accuracy to plunge from 86.7% to 82.7%. Excessive context traversal injects
  irrelevant semantic noise that derails agent attention.

### 3. SWE-Router (arXiv:2607.00053v1): Value-Head Fragility and Inflexible Budgets
- **Value-Estimator Calibration Drift**:
  The theoretical optimality of SWE-Router (Theorem 4.1) assumes a perfectly calibrated value head $\hat{r}_1$.
  In practice, value heads trained on specific repository distributions (e.g. Python repositories in SWE-bench)
  suffer catastrophic out-of-distribution drift when deployed on mixed-language, schema-heavy, or formal math
  codebases. An uncalibrated value head results in false escalations (burning tokens) or false continuations
  (sub-agents thrashing in dead ends).
- **Cold-Start Exploration Overhead**:
  Enforcing a mandatory $K=3$ exploration budget with a compact model imposes an unnecessary 3-turn latency
  and token penalty on tasks that are trivially identifiable as requiring frontier reasoning (e.g., Lean 4
  formal proofs, cryptographic invariant changes, architectural boundary reviews).
- **Impoverished Prompt Artifact**:
  The paper's claim that prompt-only routing has an irreducible Bayes-error floor is partially an artifact of
  treating raw, unstructured issue descriptions as the sole prompt input. When prompts are compiled from
  structured requirements models (e.g., CRDM, BPMN specifications), prompt-time routing precision increases
  substantially.

### 4. TCAndon-Router (arXiv:2601.04544v1): Static Ontologies and Synthetic Bias
- **Brittle Static Domain Expert Profiles**:
  TCAR relies on predefined "role cards" and static candidate pools ($A_q$). In modern software architectures,
  subsystems interact dynamically; bugs rarely respect static functional boundaries. Static routing topologies
  break down when confronted with emergent, cross-cutting architectural refactorings.
- **Synthetic Training Data Contamination**:
  TCAR's routing model is fine-tuned on synthetically generated multi-agent interaction dialogues. Synthetic
  training sets systematically underestimate real-world developer ambiguity, tool execution timeouts, and
  flaky test environments.
- **Blindness to Emergent Data Races**:
  TCAR's Andon cord relies on explicit linguistic signals of conflict or out-of-scope tags. It cannot detect
  subtle semantic data races, state corruption in shared test databases, or silent git merge collisions between
  concurrent agents.

### 5. He et al. Survey (arXiv:2404.04834v4): The Chat State-Degeneration Blindspot
- **Conversational Entropy and the Tetris Failure**:
  The survey documents that ChatDev failed 9 out of 10 times on Tetris (§4.2) due to conversational drift
  and loss of global state. Yet the survey continues to treat unconstrained multi-agent conversational chat as
  a viable foundation for complex SE. In reality, chat histories act as entropy accumulators: each conversational
  turn adds tokens, increases context ambiguity, and degrades instruction adherence.
- **Conflation of MoE and Multi-Agent Systems (§6.1)**:
  The survey's comparison between Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Multi-Agent Systems glosses over the fundamental
  inefficiency of text-serialized coordination. MoE routes internal activation vectors with zero token serialization
  overhead; multi-agent systems communicate via natural language strings, incurring massive token costs, serialization
  latency, and linguistic parsing errors.

## 4. Adversarial Pass Direction 2: Attacking Folio-Assistant's Processes

Applying the literature's critical insights to folio-assistant's own architecture exposes four significant
operational vulnerabilities across its 69 BPMN/DMN processes and SDLC skills:

                                - Sub-process context projection
                                - SWE-Router Clean Escalation Rule
                                - Deterministic Block / Agent Warn
                                - Explicit Andon-Cord Triggers
```

### 1. Context Saturation in the 69 BPMN/DMN Process Suite
- **Vulnerability**:
  Folio-assistant maintains 69 executable BPMN 2.0.2 diagrams and DMN 1.5 decision tables. Several coordinating
  skills (e.g. `coordinate.md`, `integration-watcher.md`, `crdm-*.bpmn`) tend to inject entire XML process
  specifications, schemas, and extensive markdown memory files into the agent's context window.
- **Risk**:
  As documented in `specification-compiled-agents.md` and SWE-Debate, LLM reasoning degrades as context
  saturation increases. Dumping global process state causes "needle-in-a-haystack" retrieval failure, leading
  agents to hallucinate tool capabilities, skip gateway conditions, or miss specific lint rules.
- **Remediation**:
  Enforce strict **sub-process projection**: agents executing a task must receive only their immediate task
  node, incoming/outgoing sequence flows, and the explicit DMN decision table governing the active gateway,
  never the whole-process XML graph.

### 2. Context Poisoning in Swarm Dispatch and Escalation
- **Vulnerability**:
  In `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/dispatch-agent.md` and `swarm-management.md`, sub-tasks are spawned when an agent
  encounters complex sub-problems. In common usage, the parent agent frequently forwards its entire ongoing
  conversation transcript—including failed search attempts, erroneous grep commands, and hallucinated root-cause
  hypotheses—into the subagent's prompt.
- **Risk**:
  This directly violates the **Clean Escalation Rule** established by SWE-Router (arXiv:2607.00053v1).
  Conditioning a fresh agent on an exploratory agent's flawed trajectory biases the new agent toward the same
  false assumptions, destroying the independent reasoning advantage of model escalation.
- **Remediation**:
  Codify the clean escalation restart rule across all swarm dispatch tools: when escalating a stalled task or
  spawning a specialist subagent, compile a clean task brief containing only the objective specification $q$,
  relevant file paths, and target acceptance criteria, discarding exploratory dialogue history.

### 3. Merge Queue Fragility: The Deterministic vs. Agentic Boundary
- **Vulnerability**:
  Prior to bean `nok9` and proposal `merge-gate-2026-10-02.md`, there was strong pressure to establish a
  "blocking red flag" gate where multi-agent code reviews could unilaterally reject pull requests on the merge train.
- **Risk**:
  As CodeAgent proved (Table 2), LLM vulnerability reviewers exhibit an uncalibrated false-positive rate of
  up to 48.58%. Making an LLM code reviewer a blocking gate halts the merge train over hallucinated objections,
  paralyzing development throughput and inducing alert fatigue.
- **Remediation**:
  Strictly preserve the owner's 2026-10-02/10-03 ruling:
  - **Deterministic compile/test gates (G1, G2, G5–G8) MUST BLOCK**: Lean 4 formal math compilation, SUSHI/FHIR
    AST compilation, JSON-LD schema renders, linter suites, and unit tests answer questions with one machine-settled
    truth.
  - **Agentic reviews (G3, G4) MUST WARN**: LLM reviewers exit 0, emit structured advisories, and record
    "would have blocked" sidecars. Promotion to a blocking gate is forbidden until an agent demonstrates an
    empirically calibrated false-positive rate below 5% across recorded historical defects (`plj1`, `dh4f`, `w4tq`, `7u3g`).

### 4. Zombie Agent Runs and the Lack of Programmatic Andon Cords
- **Vulnerability**:
  While `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/swarm-management.md` describes the conceptual discipline of stopping early, the
  underlying runner (`invoke_subagent`, background shell commands) lacked automated runtime predicates to detect
  and kill runaway agents.
- **Risk**:
  An agent trapped in an infinite search loop, circular git merge conflict, or hallucinated dependency chain
  continues to burn tokens until hitting wall-clock timeouts, draining API budgets and creating zombie lockouts
  in the bean store.
- **Remediation**:
  Implement explicit **programmatic Andon-cord stopping predicates**:
  ```typescript
  // Programmatic Andon-Cord Halt Predicates
  function evaluateAndonCord(trajectory: AgentTurn[]): { halt: boolean; reason?: string } {
    if (detectStructuralInterfaceConflict(trajectory)) {
      return { halt: true, reason: "Structural interface divergence detected across workers" };
    }
    if (detectMissingPrerequisites(trajectory)) {
      return { halt: true, reason: "Out-of-scope / missing input files (TCAR oos condition)" };

## 6. Implementation Checklist for Agents and Swarm Stewards

When coordinating multi-agent work, opening beans, or stewarding merge trains, verify these six invariants:

1. **Before dispatching a swarm**:
   - Check if the task is consultation/extraction ($|A_q|=1$). If so, **do not spawn a swarm**; dispatch a single compact worker.
   - For troubleshooting/diagnostic tasks, restrict the initial pool to $\le 3$ candidate specialists.
2. **During multi-turn execution**:
   - Limit compact model exploration to $K=3$ turns.
   - If the task is not progressing, **pull the Andon cord** immediately. Do not allow agents to run to timeout.
3. **When escalating to a frontier model**:
   - **Do not forward the exploratory chat history.** Re-compile the prompt from clean specifications, passing only verified file paths and objective error messages.
4. **When executing adversarial code reviews**:
   - Restrict block dependency graph traversal to depth $L \le 5$.
   - Never use LLMs for syntax, formatting, or typechecking. Run `bun run cat gates`.
5. **In the merge train**:
   - Enforce hard failure on Tier 1 & Tier 2 deterministic gates (Lean, SUSHI, JSON-LD, ESLint, TypeScript).
   - Enforce warn-only (`exit 0`) status on Tier 4 agentic reviews, emitting structured sidecars with `"would have blocked"` audit tags.
6. **In debate and adjudication**:
   - Reserve 3-round competitive debate exclusively for high-blast-radius headline theorems or disputed audit criteria.
   - The adjudicator must synthesize technical arguments and explicitly document `resolved_conflicts` rather than voting or averaging confidence scores.
