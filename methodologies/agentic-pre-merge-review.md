# Tool-Integrated Agentic Pre-Merge Review — Multi-Agent Verification Loops, Supervised Consistency, and Gate Boundaries

**Adopted 2026-10-09.** Ingested under `library/arxiv-2402.02172v5` (35pp, outline read
via `pdf-structure` with 32 greppable sections, 135 raster inspection verdicts, and 19
rendered vector figures). Synthesized with epic bean `folio-assistant-nok9`, formal
split bean `folio-assistant-h1uq`, the owner's 2026-10-02/10-03 rulings, and proposal
`cat-harness/docs/proposals/merge-gate-2026-10-02.md`.

## 1. The Core Thesis of Tool-Integrated Multi-Agent Review

Single-turn, single input-output generative models struggle to automate code review because
code review is inherently interactive, multi-perspective, and communicative. A lone model
prompted to review an entire diff hallucinates bugs, misses subtle semantic discrepancies,
and produces ungrounded rewrite advice without validation.

CodeAgent proposes decomposing code review into **specialized communicative agents** across
four sequential waterfall phases, supervised by an instruction-driven **QA-Checker**:

| Phase | Roles | Core Function |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Basic Info Sync** | CEO, CTO, Coder | Synchronize context: classify input modalities (prose, code, AST) and target programming languages (Python, Java, Go, C++, etc.). |
| **2. Code Review** | Reviewer, Coder | Execute multi-perspective analysis: Consistency Analysis (CA), Vulnerability Analysis (VA), Format Analysis (FA), and Code Revision suggestions (CR). |
| **3. Code Alignment** | Coder, Reviewer | Iteratively revise diffs, reconcile syntax discrepancies, and propose concrete patches. |
| **4. Document** | CEO, CPO, Coder, Reviewer | Synthesize reviewer reports, summarize actions, and produce an integrated review verdict for human maintainers. |

### The Supervisory QA-Checker Mechanism
In each pairwise conversation between an Instructor agent and an Assistor agent, conversational
drift is common: agents stray from the initial diff or fabricate unverifiable assertions.
CodeAgent introduces a **QA-Checker** that evaluates each turn's answer $a_i$ against the instruction
$q_i$. If $a_i$ is non-responsive or incomplete, the QA-Checker computes an augmented instruction:
$$q_{i+1} = \text{CB}(q_i + \text{aai}_i)$$
where $\text{aai}_i$ is an added adjustment instruction. The dialogue iterates until the QA-Checker
verifies that the answer directly answers the query, or until a hard `max_dialogue_turns` cutoff is reached.

## 2. Systematic Attack on CodeAgent's Empirical Claims

While CodeAgent reports impressive headline improvements over baseline zero-shot models, critical
analysis of arXiv:2402.02172v5 reveals four major structural vulnerabilities that must be guarded
against in production SDLC pipelines:

### Attack 1: The 49% False-Positive Trap & Annotation Circularity
CodeAgent's empirical evaluation (§4.1, Table 2) reveals a staggering false-positive rate for standalone LLMs:
- **GPT-4 confirmed only 345 vulnerabilities out of 671 flagged items** — a **48.58% false-positive rate** (nearly half of all warnings were noise!).
- **GPT-3.5 had a 63.31% false-positive rate** (only 36.69% confirmed).
- **CodeBERT had an 80.06% false-positive rate** (only 19.94% confirmed).

Even more concerning is CodeAgent's own methodology for its claimed 92.96% confirmation rate:
> *"We therefore propose a proactive method for data annotation: we execute CodeAgent on the 3,545 samples... and manual verify the identified cases to build a ground truth."* (§4.1)

**This is circular confirmation bias.** The ground truth was constructed by having humans inspect *only the items CodeAgent flagged*. Unflagged commits were never exhaustively audited by human security experts, completely hiding false negatives. In an automated CI gate, an uncalibrated LLM reviewer with a ~49% false-positive rate causes severe "alert fatigue", prompting developers to ignore or rubber-stamp review notices.

### Attack 2: Runaway Iteration Costs and Latency Explosions
CodeAgent's multi-agent dialogues and QA-Checker loops incur substantial computational overhead (Table 12, Appendix Section N):
- **Query latency**: An average review requires **3 minutes** for CodeAgent-3.5 and **5 minutes** for CodeAgent-4.0 per pull request.
- **Financial cost**: CodeAgent-4 costs **$0.122 per review**, driven by multi-turn prompt expansion across six agents and repeated conversational turns.
- **Context saturation**: In large PR diffs spanning multiple files, the concatenation of full source context, dialogue history, and QA adjustment instructions quickly saturates the context window, causing prompt truncation or degraded reasoning.
- **Convergence failure**: If the QA-Checker and Reviewer disagree, the loop oscillates until hitting `max_dialogue_turns`. Running synchronous 5-minute multi-agent loops on every push to a merge train would bottleneck merge throughput.

### Attack 3: Toolchain Substitution vs. Semantic Delusion
CodeAgent includes "Format Analysis" (FA) as one of its four core evaluation pillars, employing multi-turn LLMs to check indentation, trailing whitespace, and line lengths.
- **This is an SDLC antipattern.** Deterministic tools (Prettier, ESLint, `clang-format`, `gofmt`) verify and fix formatting in under **100 milliseconds** with mathematical certainty and zero token cost. Using multi-turn LLM agent conversations to debate indentation is wasteful and error-prone.
- **Tool integration must be external and executable**: An agent should not *pretend* to lint; it must *execute* the project's linter and formatters via deterministic subcommands, parsing the tool's machine-readable exit status.

## 3. The Literature Gap and Noise Boundaries

Across five foundational papers investigating agentic software engineering and automated review:
- **CodeAgent** (Zhang et al. 2024, arXiv:2402.02172v5)
- **SWE-Debate** (arXiv:2404.04834v4)
- **SWE-Router** (arXiv:2507.23348v1)
- **TCAndon-Router** (arXiv:2601.04544v1)
- **He et al.** (arXiv:2607.00053v1)

**None reports an empirical false-positive rate (FPR) for an LLM judge.** The nearest available empirical figures point in the wrong direction:
- In CodeAgent's own manual annotation, **48.6% of GPT-4's raised flags were unconfirmed** upon human inspection.
- The headline precision figures in literature are evaluated over restricted, hand-filtered subsets, with circular ground truths and no reporting of true negative baselines or blinding.
- SWE-Router and SWE-Debate demonstrate that LLM judges exhibit severe self-enhancement bias (favoring model-generated code), verbosity bias, and positional sensitivity.

Because external benchmarks cannot establish reliability on this repository's code, the false-positive rate must be directly measured here.

## 4. Why Only a Warn-Only Phase Can Produce an FPR

A hard blocking gate destroys counterfactual evidence:
1. When an agentic gate blocks a pull request, the PR does not merge.
2. The author either rewrites the code to appease the reviewer, works around the flag, or abandons the change.
3. Once the code is altered, it is impossible to determine whether the original flag was a **true positive** (prevented a real defect) or a **false positive** (blocked valid, harmless code).

A warn-only review solves this counterfactual dilemma:
- A `blocking`-severity finding is recorded as **"would have blocked"** (`WouldHaveBlockedRecordSchema` in `schemas/merge-queue.ts`), bound to the PR's exact 40-character `headSha`.
- The PR is allowed to merge into `main` (provided deterministic compile checks and CI pass).
- The resulting deployment is observed against real repository health and defects.
- A human judge subsequently annotates the finding with a `humanVerdict`:
  - `true_positive`: The finding correctly identified a defect that broke or would break invariants.
  - `false_positive`: The finding was an unconfirmed alarm or incorrect criticism; the change was sound.
  - `unknown`: The outcome cannot be decisively confirmed or verified.

### The third-state rule

`unknown` is strictly maintained as an independent third state:
- Folding `unknown` into `true_positive` artificially deflates the false-positive rate:
  $\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP} + \text{Unknown}}$ (falsely optimistic).
- Folding `unknown` into `false_positive` artificially inflates the false-positive rate:
  $\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP} + \text{Unknown}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP} + \text{Unknown}}$ (falsely punitive).
- The correct empirical formulation is:
  $$\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{confirmedFalsePositives}}{\text{confirmedTruePositives} + \text{confirmedFalsePositives}}$$
  while tracking **review coverage**:
  $$\text{Coverage} = \frac{\text{confirmedTruePositives} + \text{confirmedFalsePositives}}{\text{warnedFindings}}$$

## 5. Pre-Merge Gate Integration & The nok9 Settlement

### The Owner's 2026-10-02 Ask vs. The 2026-10-02/10-03 Ruling
On 2026-10-02, the repository owner requested:
> *"full agentic adversarial software code review on changes done by >= 1 agent; no blocking RED FLAGS from any agentic review; (if math content block) any lean changes compile; (if FHIR IG) sushi/IG AST compiles; json(ld)+schema for the KG renders..."*

Later that same day, the owner ruled on the merge gate behavior:
> *"dont want hard gate (at least not for now, lots of backlog on content nodes) but do want warn."*
> Confirmed 2026-10-03: *"warn only. proposal predates ruling, update it."*

### The Load-Bearing Boundary: Deterministic vs. Judged
The boundary is **deterministic-vs-judged, not blocking-vs-warning**.
- **Deterministic checks (G1, G2, G5, G6, G7, G8)**: Lean formal math compilation, SUSHI/FHIR IG AST compilation, JSON-LD schema verification, and unit test suites answer questions with **one computable truth**. A machine settles them unequivocally. **These MUST BLOCK merge.**
- **Agentic reviews (G3, G4)**: LLM judges answer questions with **unverified and non-zero false-positive rates**. Enforcing a blocking gate on an LLM judge whose error rate is unmeasured halts PR flow over hallucinated objections. **These MUST WARN.**

### The `dependency-advisories` Pattern
Following `dependency-advisories` in `.github/workflows/code-quality-gates.yml`:
1. Exit 0 in every state: the review reports and does not fail CI.
2. Distinctly output three states: `clean` (found nothing), `findings` (found issues), and `could-not-determine` (review tool failed or timed out).
3. **Never use `continue-on-error`**: that keyword collapses unexecutable tools into apparent passes.
4. Record blocking-weight findings as **"would have blocked"**: this creates an empirical audit trail to measure the agent's real-world precision before any future promotion to a blocking gate.

## 6. The Synthesized Pre-Merge SDLC Methodology

To operationalize the valid insights of CodeAgent while insulating the merge queue from its pitfalls,
folio-assistant establishes a four-tier pre-merge verification pipeline:

```
[PR / Merge Candidate]
          │
          ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 1: Fast Deterministic Gates              │
│ (bun run cat gates: linters, types, tests)    │ ──[FAIL]──► BLOCK MERGE (Machine Settled)
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │ PASS
          ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 2: Path-Scoped Compile Gates             │
│ (Lean formal proofs, SUSHI/FHIR, JSON-LD)     │ ──[FAIL]──► BLOCK MERGE (Domain Compilers)
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │ PASS
          ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 3: Tool-Integrated Adversarial Review    │
│ (Automated Static Analyzers + Linters)        │ ──[FAIL]──► BLOCK MERGE (Syntax/Types)
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │ PASS
          ▼
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Tier 4: Supervised Agentic Review (Adversarial)│
│ - Semantic Commit-Code Consistency (CA)       │
│ - Security / Logic Vulnerability Review (VA)  │ ──► WARN ONLY ("Would have blocked")
│ - Supervised by QA-Checker (Convergence Guard)│     Exit 0; Record sidecar verdict
└───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │
          ▼
[Merge Train Admission / Human Override]
```

### Operational Rules for Implementers:
1. **Deterministic Precedence**: Never use an LLM for an assertion that a deterministic tool settles. Format, lint, compile, and type-check steps must be executed directly by CLI tools.
2. **Warn-Only Gating**: All Tier 4 agentic reviews emit structured advisories (`warn`), never blocking merge trains automatically.
3. **Structured Finding Sidecars**: Reviews must emit JSON sidecars recording findings categorized by severity:
   - `advisory`: style or non-critical suggestions.
   - `would-have-blocked`: critical logic errors or security vulnerabilities.
4. **Historical Ground-Truth Calibration**: Before any review finding is promoted to a blocking gate, the agent reviewer must be tested against recorded repository defects (`plj1`, `dh4f`, `w4tq`, `7u3g`) that did not exist in base training corpora, demonstrating a measured false-positive rate below 5%.
5. **Bounded Dialogue Budgets**: QA-Checker refinement loops must cap at a maximum of 2 adjustment iterations, falling back to `could-not-determine` if semantic consensus is not reached within 60 seconds.

## 7. Pre-Registered Promotion Criteria

To prevent post-hoc rationalization (choosing thresholds to fit collected data),
the promotion criteria are pre-registered in `schemas/merge-queue.ts`
(`AgenticPromotionCriteriaSchema`):

| Parameter | Threshold | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `minimumPrWindow` | **50 PRs** | Sufficient statistical power over real PRs across multiple sessions and subsystems. |
| `maximumFalsePositiveRate` | **≤ 0.05 (5%)** | An automated blocker cannot cry wolf more than 1 in 20 flags without eroding developer trust and inducing alert fatigue. |
| `minimumReviewCoverage` | **≥ 0.80 (80%)** | At least 80% of warned findings must be conclusively adjudicated; a low-coverage evaluation cannot promote on high `unknown` rates. |

Promotion from warn-only to blocking requires that **all three criteria** are simultaneously satisfied.

---

## 8. Current Architectural Decision: Staying WARN-ONLY

As ruled by the repository owner on 2026-10-02 and confirmed 2026-10-03:
- **Agentic adversarial review is WARN-ONLY.** Findings are reported as warnings with `would-have-blocked` records; they do not block merging.
- **Deterministic compile gates remain BLOCKING**:
  - G5: Lean module build and axiom verification.
  - G6: SUSHI FHIR compilation.
  - G7: JSON-LD schema expansion and compaction.
- **Rationale**:
  1. The literature demonstrates a ~49% unconfirmed flag rate for LLM reviewers.
  2. No empirical false-positive rate has yet been measured on this repository.
  3. Pre-registered promotion criteria (window ≥ 50, FPR ≤ 5%, coverage ≥ 80%) have not yet been met.
