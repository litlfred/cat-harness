# SDLC Agentic Landscape — Mapping LLM Multi-Agent Systems to the Software Lifecycle

**Adopted from arXiv:2404.04834v4 (He, Treude, and Lo, 2025).** The comprehensive survey maps
the state of LLM-based multi-agent (LMA) systems across every phase of the software development
lifecycle (SDLC), contrasting team architectures, collaboration topologies, and benchmark results.

This node establishes the systematic cross-cutting comparison between the survey's SDLC taxonomy
and the 69 executable BPMN/DMN processes in this platform.

## 1. The Survey's SDLC Phase Taxonomy

He et al. synthesize empirical literature into six foundational SDLC phases:

| SDLC Phase | Focus & Key Activities | Representative LMA Systems |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Requirements Engineering** | Elicitation of user needs, domain modeling, requirement formalization/specification, consistency analysis, validation | Elicitron, MARE, AgileGen (Gherkin-based) |
| **2. Software Design** | Architecture design, system decomposition, API contracts, interface specifications, role delegation | MetaGPT (Architect agent), ChatDev, DevLoops |
| **3. Code Generation & Implementation** | Multi-agent pair programming, role-specialized coding, teacher-student self-repair, retrieval-augmented coding | INTERVENOR, Self-repair, TGen, FlowGen |
| **4. Software Quality Assurance** | Test case generation, fault localization, vulnerability detection, cross-validation, static analysis pruning | ICAA, RCAgent, AgentFL, ChatDev (Tester agent) |
| **5. Software Maintenance** | Automated program repair (APR), debugging, code review, test case maintenance, dependency migration | MASAI, MarsCode, AutoCodeRover, Lemner et al. |
| **6. Software Management & Collaboration** | Process modeling (Waterfall vs. Agile sprints), agent coordination, resource allocation, human-agent collaboration | ChatDev, MetaGPT, AgileCoder, Think-on-Process (ToP) |

                            - Requirements (CRDM)    - Post-deployment telemetry
                            - Formal Design (BPMN)   - Runtime APM log monitoring
                            - Controlled Generation  - Legacy reverse-engineering

                            - Serialized Integration
```

### A. Requirements Engineering: Full Coverage
- **CRDM Process Suite (`processes/process/crdm-*.bpmn`)**:
  - `crdm-needs.bpmn`: Systematic stakeholder needs capture.
  - `crdm-requirements-definition.bpmn` & `crdm-requirements.bpmn`: Structured specification.
  - `crdm-data-model.bpmn`: Domain entity mapping.
  - `crdm-signoff.bpmn` & `processes/process/decisions/requirement-signoff-recorded.dmn`: Formal gateway enforcing explicit human signoff.
- **Specification-Compiled Agents (`methodologies/specification-compiled-agents.md`)**:
  - Compiles declarative requirements directly into verifiable agent constraints.

### B. Software Design: Full Coverage
- **Executable Process & Decision Modeling (`processes/`)**:
  - System architecture is modeled in OMG standard BPMN 2.0.2 and DMN 1.5, serving as the machine-verifiable source of truth rather than informal diagrams.
- **Architecture Decision Records (`methodologies/madr.md`, `processes/sdlc/options-analysis.bpmn`)**:
  - Structured decision logging capturing context, options, decision drivers, and trade-offs.
- **Role & Swimlane Topology (`processes/process/actor-role-administration.bpmn`, `methodologies/raci.md`)**:
  - Strict separation between persistent actors, process roles, and skill bundles.
- **Wireframe & UI Design Reviews (`processes/ui/wireframe-design-review.bpmn`, `methodologies/wiregen.md`)**:
  - Structured transformation from intent to reviewed mid-fidelity user interface specifications.

### C. Code Generation & Implementation: Strong Controlled Coverage
- **Authoring Adapters & Profile Checking**:
  - Strict containment of generated artifacts via schemas and Zod validators (preventing unstructured hallucinated code).
- **Formal Verification & Lean 4 Formalization**:
  - Translating natural language assertions into formal mathematical proofs and verified Lean siblings.
- **Hybrid LLM/Deterministic Execution (`methodologies/hybrid-llm-deterministic.md`)**:
  - The model emits a verifiable rule or program (e.g. JSONata, Lean, AST transform), which deterministic machinery compiles and runs.
- **Parallel Dispatch & Heartbeat Contracts (`skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/dispatch-agent.md`)**:
  - Live 2-minute status heartbeats and progress monitoring contracts preventing agent dark runs.

### D. Software Quality Assurance & Testing: Rigorous Evidence-Based Coverage
- **Code Quality Gates (`processes/sdlc/code-quality-gates.bpmn`, `bun run cat gates`)**:
  - Derived dynamically from CI workflows; gates run both static lints, typechecks, schema checks, and browser suites.
- **Verifiable AI Guideline Evaluation (`methodologies/verifiable-ai-guideline-evaluation.md`)**:
  - Multi-agent cross-examination with statistical consensus (e.g., Fleiss' kappa, Gwet's AC1).
- **QA Reports & Attestations (`processes/sdlc/qa-report-signing.bpmn`, `processes/sdlc/decisions/signing-route.dmn`)**:
  - Commit-keyed QA verdicts stored on orphan branches (`qa-reports`) and signed attestations.
- **L1 Ingest & Completeness Audits (`scripts/check-l1-complete.ts`)**:
  - Exhaustive multi-arm verification of documents, blocks, images, and figures.

### E. Software Maintenance & Review: High Coverage
- **Adversarial & Multi-Perspective Reviews**:
  - `processes/sdlc/code-change-review.bpmn`, `narrative-code-review.bpmn`, and `processes/content/voice-review.bpmn` evaluate changes across competing perspectives (pedantry, security, architecture, user experience).
- **Upstream Version & Pin Management**:
  - `processes/sdlc/upstream-pin-watch.bpmn` and `upstream-version-adoption.bpmn` guard against dependency drift.
- **Criterion Adjudication (`processes/sdlc/adjudication.bpmn`, `criterion-adjudication.bpmn`)**:
  - Evidence-backed resolution of audit findings and defects.

### F. Software Management & Collaboration: Industrial-Grade Governance
- **Git-Backed Work-Plan Coordination (`processes/sdlc/bean-lifecycle.bpmn`, `skills/sdlc/sdlc-core/bean-coordination.md`)**:
  - Branch-local claims, no duplicate bean creation, explicit holder notes, and scrap-over-delete discipline.
- **Serialized Merge Train & Merge Steward (`processes/sdlc/merge-train.bpmn`, `decisions/merge-priority.dmn`)**:
  - Avoids multi-agent git race conditions and conflicting concurrent pushes to main.

## 3. Gap Analysis: Where Folio-Assistant Gaps Exist

The survey identifies emerging operational paradigms where folio-assistant does not currently maintain active processes:

└────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Post-Deployment Monitoring & Operational Telemetry**:
   - *Current state*: Folio-assistant monitors CI health (`ci-health-watch.bpmn`) and GitHub Pages deployment status, but stops at the boundary of static site and artifact delivery.
   - *Survey benchmark*: Systems like RCAgent analyze cloud telemetry, parse real-time logs, and identify system anomalies during live runtime execution.
   - *Recommendation*: Introduce an `operational-monitoring` process group if folio-assistant deploys active microservices or continuous services.

2. **Runtime APM & Telemetry Closed-Loop Ingestion**:
   - *Current state*: Audit failures in CI create local and branch-level reports. Production telemetry does not feed back into the `beans` graph.
   - *Survey benchmark*: Automated incident-to-bug-report translation with automated regression test generation.
   - *Recommendation*: Connect external issue alerts and crash-reporters into automated triage beans (`stalled-agent-triage` / `issue-working`).

3. **Legacy Software Reverse Engineering**:
   - *Current state*: Folio-assistant excels in forward-engineering from formal specifications, guidelines, and schemas.
   - *Survey benchmark*: Agents that ingest 100k-LOC legacy C/Java codebases with no tests and reverse-engineer requirements and architecture.
   - *Recommendation*: Develop an extraction adapter to reconstruct BPMN/DMN diagrams and CRDM requirement models from existing code repositories.

## 4. Key Takeaways for Agentic Platform Design

1. **Process Rigor Trumps Unconstrained Multi-Agent Chat**:
   As He et al. demonstrate in their Tetris case study, unconstrained agent conversation (e.g. ChatDev) fails repeatedly (9 out of 10 attempts failed, with the final attempt still missing core line-clearing logic) when tasks require deep stateful logic. Folio-assistant's deterministic process boundaries, DMN rules, and compiler shims prevent these catastrophic failures.
2. **Hybrid Deterministic/LLM Architecture is Essential**:
   Pure generative coding degrades with complexity. Inverting the model's responsibility from generating whole output to generating validated rules (`methodologies/hybrid-llm-deterministic.md`) matches the survey's research agenda for Phase 1 (specialized agent capability enhancement).
3. **Multi-Agent Coordination Requires Serialized Governance**:
   Uncoordinated agent swarms produce merge chaos and duplicated work. Folio-assistant's bean claims and merge steward fulfill the survey's Phase 2 vision for optimizing agent synergy and leveraging industry software engineering principles.
