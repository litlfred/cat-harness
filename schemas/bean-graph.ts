/**
 * The bean graph — what `beans/` is, rather than where it happens to be.
 *
 * `beans/` is not a directory that incidentally holds markdown. It is a
 * **graph** with named nodes, each node a store with its own kind and path:
 *
 * ```jsonc
 *  // beans/beans.json
 * {
 *   "name": "folio-assistant",
 *   "nodes": [
 *     { "id": "defs",      "path": "defs",      "kinds": ["bean-defs"] },
 *     { "id": "workflows", "path": "workflows", "kinds": ["workflow-state"] }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than a block in the harness config
 *
 * The predecessor (bean `8xzw`) declared both paths in `harness.config.json`
 * under `harness.workPlan` / `harness.workflowState`. That was one source of
 * truth too many: the same path was already written in `.beans.yml`, which the
 * third-party `beans` binary reads, so `check:harness-dirs` existed to stop the
 * two drifting.
 *
 * Moving the declaration here does not add a third place — it **removes one**.
 * The graph states the layout; the harness config no longer restates it.
 *
 * **The `.beans.yml` duplication survives and is not a defect of this design.**
 * `beans` is third-party and will never read our schema, so its path must be
 * written where it looks. That duplication stays checked, because an unchecked
 * duplication is the thing this repository has paid for repeatedly.
 *
 * ## Paths are relative to the graph root, deliberately
 *
 * A node's `path` is resolved against the directory holding `beans.json`, not
 * against the repo root. So the graph is **relocatable**: moving `beans/` to
 * `work/` requires editing nothing inside it. A path escaping its own root
 * (`..`, or absolute) is rejected — a store outside the graph it belongs to is
 * not a node of that graph, and silently accepting one would let a folio scan
 * a directory its graph does not own.
 *
 * ## Three states, as everywhere here
 *
 * - **Absent** → `undefined`. An unmigrated repo falls back to the documented
 *   defaults; this is ordinary, not an error.
 * - **Present but unreadable** → **throws**. A graph nobody can parse leaves
 *   every consumer guessing where the work plan is, which is worse than having
 *   no graph at all — the fallback is at least documented.
 * - **Unknown node kind** → rejected, not accepted and ignored. A node whose
 *   kind nothing understands is a store nothing will read.
 *
 * ## It defers to `cat-harness.ts`, and does not restate it
 *
 * A bean-graph entry IS a {@link ContentDirectory}: an id, a path, and the
 * graph typologies found there. Same schema, same open registry, same JSON-LD
 * projection.
 *
 * This file briefly had its own parallel vocabulary — `nodes` with
 * `kinds: BeanNodeKind[]`, a closed Zod enum — which said exactly what
 * `directories` with `graphs: GraphTypology[]` already said, in different words.
 * Two spellings of one concept is the drift this repository keeps paying for,
 * so the kinds moved into `BASE_GRAPH_TYPOLOGIES` and the shape is now imported
 * rather than redeclared.
 *
 * What remains here is only what is SPECIFIC to the bean graph and not true
 * of declarations generally: paths resolve against this file's own directory
 * rather than the instance root, and at most one directory may hold
 * `workflow-state`.
 *
 * @module schemas/bean-graph
 * @graphNode schema
