/**
 * RED FLAG taxonomy, adversarial review sidecar schema, and recorded override path.
 *
 * Implements child (c) of merge gate epic (bean `folio-assistant-abmq`, proposal
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/merge-gate-2026-10-02.md` §6).
 *
 * ## What is a RED FLAG?
 *
 * A RED FLAG is a finding the reviewer asserts **would block the merge**
 * (amended 2026-10-03 by owner ruling; it asserted "blocks the merge" until
 * the warn-only ruling). It reuses the two existing axes in `schemas/qa-review.ts`:
 * - `FindingSeverity` (critical | major | minor: what kind of breakage)
 * - `FindingWeight` (blocking | suggestion | praise: what the reviewer asks of the gate)
 *
 * A RED FLAG is `weight: "blocking"` with a category from a closed taxonomy:
 * `security`, `data-loss`, `correctness`, `false-green`, `provenance`,
 * `scope-breach`, `irreversible-action`, `licence`.
 *
 * Evidence is strictly REQUIRED for any `blocking` finding: a finding without
 * reproducible observation cannot be blocking (it is demoted to `suggestion`).
 *
 * ## The 2026-10-03 owner ruling: warn-only review
 *
 * The review warns, it does not block:
 * > dont want hard gate (at least not for now, lots of backlog on content nodes)
 * > but do want warn.
 *
 * An open red flag is evaluated by the gate as `would-have-blocked` rather than
 * holding the merge. This preserves the taxonomy and the `blocking` weight
 * while producing the data needed for future gate promotion decisions.
 *
 * ## The human override path
 *
 * A red flag is NEVER deleted. An override is a recorded decision by a human
 * with standing (who, when, why, and finding ID). The finding's status becomes
 * `overridden` with a full resolution record; the gate passes on `resolved` or
 * `overridden` and warns/blocks on `open` / `would-have-blocked`.
 *
 * @module schemas/red-flag
 * @graphNode schema
