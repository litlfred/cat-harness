 *
 * So a page never chooses its URL and never claims a directory. The HARNESS
 * declares each visualiser in its own `<instance>.json` (`visualisers`, see
 * `HarnessVisualiserSchema` in `cat-harness.ts`), and the route is a pure
 * function of that declaration:
 *
 * | route | what it is |
 * |---|---|
 * | `<base>/<harness>/<visualiser>/` | the visualiser over the full KG it covers |
 * | `<base>/<harness>/<visualiser>/<sub-graph>/` | the same visualiser over one sub-graph |
 * | `<base>/<harness>/<visualiser>/<sub-graph>/<path>` | an asset of that sub-graph's view |
 * | `<base>/<harness>/<visualiser>/<path>` | an asset of the full view (a per-node page, its data) |
 *
 * `<harness>` is the declaring instance's `name`, `<visualiser>` the entry's
 * `id`. Both are URL segments, checked by {@link ROUTE_SEGMENT}, never encoded:
 * an id that is not a portable segment is a defect in the declaration, and
 * encoding it would publish a URL the declaration no longer spells.
 *
 * ## Why collisions are now DECLARATION errors
 *
 * Under page-derived discovery (#1168 B7a-2b) a page said which directories it
 * drew and where it was, so two generators could write one URL and each page
 * could claim the same directory — and nothing could tell which claim was the
 * declaration. With the route derived from `(harness, visualiser)`, two claims
 * on one URL are two declarations naming one pair, which is checkable before
 * anything is drawn: {@link routeCollisions}, run by
 * `check:visualiser-routes`.
 *
 * ## The opt-in alias — bean `t4xb`
 *
 * > `<base_url>/<visualizer>` is an opt-in (for prettiness or so), but
 * > `<base_url>/<harness>/<visualizer>` always works.
 *
 * A visualiser may declare `alias`. The page is still drawn ONCE, at its
 * canonical route; the composed site carries a redirect at `<base>/<alias>/`
 * (`compose-docs.ts`). An alias that collides with another alias, with a
 * harness's own route or with anything the site already publishes at its top
 * level is refused by the gate, naming both claimants.
 *
 * This module is pure — no filesystem — so the schema layer, the generators
 * and the gate can all import it without an edge to any of them.
