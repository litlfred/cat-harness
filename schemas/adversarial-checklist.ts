/**
 * Per-content-block adversarial checklists for tools, schemas, skills, and processes.
 *
 * Implements child (d) of the merge gate epic (bean `folio-assistant-lvlv`, proposal
 * `cat-harness/docs/proposals/merge-gate-2026-10-02.md` §7).
 *
 * ## Extending, not forking
 *
 * The adversarial review runs per **content block** (not per diff) so the existing
 * corpus can be backfilled. These checklists extend existing skills rather than
 * forking them:
 * - `tool`: extends `code-node-review` (fidelity, side-effects, unknown-on-failure, deletion guard)
 * - `schema`: extends `code-node-review` (reader existence, closed enums, docstring fidelity, backwards compatibility)
 * - `skill`: extends `devils-advocate-watcher` and `narrative-asserts-code` (truth of code claims, no contradiction, no prose counts, no unasked irreversible actions)
 * - `process`: extends `kg-audit` criteria (complete gateway branching including failure paths, context graph read/write discipline, diagram-to-execution fidelity)
 *
 * @module schemas/adversarial-checklist
