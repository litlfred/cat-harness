/**
 * The NODES of a node kind, found where its typologies say they are — issue
 * #2195, PR 2.
 *
 * @module cat-harness/schemas/node-kind-nodes
 * @graphNode none — a reader over declared directories; it defines no schema
 *
 * A kind's page lists its own nodes and its subclasses' (owner, 2026-10-05:
 * *"i want to see node that subclass a given node kind"*). Where to look is
 * already declared twice over: the node-kind index says which typologies hold
 * each kind, and each instance's `<instance>.json` says which of its
 * directories have that typology. This joins the two and reads the files.
 *
 * A file belongs to a kind when the kind ACCEPTS its `$schema` — same name,
 * same major, no newer minor (`acceptsSchemaTag`) — so a node written under an
 * earlier minor still appears. JSON nodes carry the tag as `$schema`; Markdown
 * nodes (todos) carry it in their front matter.
 *
 * Each node is filed under the HARNESS that holds it — the instance whose
 * declaration names the directory — with a path relative to that instance's
 * root and without its extension. That path is the node's stable address:
 * `<declaring>/<kind>/<harness>/<path>`. A repository-scoped directory sits
 * OUTSIDE its declaring instance's root, so its nodes are addressed relative
 * to the repository instead; an instance-relative path would start `../`.
 *
 * ## Two things this does NOT read (bean `ujiv`, issue #88)
 *
 * - **A directory whose content is off the checkout** — a `source` other than
 *   `directory`, e.g. beans and todos kept at the tip of a state branch. What a
 *   checkout holds there is a mount of a branch that moves on its own, so a
 *   page committed from it is stale the moment the branch moves, and no commit
 *   can keep up. The state viewer renders those nodes live. A NESTED entry
 *   (`within`) inherits its parent's source, since the nested entry itself
 *   carries none.
 * - Nothing else is skipped. A kind with no typology (an instance declaration)
 *   is found by its NAME RULE instead: see `NAME_RULE_KINDS` in `node-kind-index.ts`.
